Preface



Greetings!

You've probably asked yourself at least once how an operating 
system is written from the ground up. You might even have years 
of programming experience under your belt, yet your understanding 
of operating systems may still be a collection of abstract 
concepts not grounded in actual implementation. To those who've 
never built one, an operating system may seem like magic: a 
mysterious thing that can control hardware while handling a 
programmer's requests via the API of their favorite programming 
language. Learning how to build an operating system seems 
intimidating and difficult; no matter how much you learn, it 
never feels like you know enough. You're probably reading this 
book right now to gain a better understanding of operating 
systems to be a better software engineer.

If that is the case, this book is for you. By going through this 
book, you will be able to find the missing pieces that are 
essential and enable you to implement your own operating system 
from scratch! Yes, from scratch without going through any 
existing operating system layer to prove to yourself that you are 
an operating system developer. You may ask,“Isn't it more 
practical to learn the internals of Linux?”.

Yes...

and no.

Learning Linux can help your workflow at your day job. However, 
if you follow that route, you still won't achieve the ultimate 
goal of writing an actual operating system. By writing your own 
operating system, you will gain knowledge that you will not be 
able to glean just from learning Linux.

Here's a list of some benefits of writing your own OS:

• You will learn how a computer works at the hardware level, and 
  you will learn to write software to manage that hardware 
  directly.

• You will learn the fundamentals of operating systems, allowing 
  you to adapt to any operating system, not just Linux

• To hack on Linux internals suitably, you'll need to write at 
  least one operating system on your own. This is just like 
  applications programming: to write a large application, you'll 
  need to start with simple ones.

• You will open pathways to various low-level programming domains 
  such as reverse engineering, exploits, building virtual 
  machines, game console emulation and more. Assembly language 
  will become one of your most indispensable tools for low-level 
  analysis. (But that does not mean you have to write your 
  operating system in Assembly!)

• Writing an operating system is fun!

  Why another book on Operating Systems?

There are many books and courses on this topic made by famous 
professors and experts out there already. Who am I to write a 
book on such an advanced topic? While it's true that many quality 
resources exist, I find them lacking. Do any of them show you how 
to compile your C code and the C runtime library independent of 
an existing operating system? Most books on operating system 
design and implementation only discuss the software side; how the 
operating system communicates with the hardware is skipped. 
Important hardware details are skipped, and it's difficult for a 
self-learner to find relevant resources on the Internet. The aim 
of this book is to bridge that gap: not only will you learn how 
to program hardware directly, but also how to read official 
documents from hardware vendors to program it. You no longer have 
to seek out resources to help yourself interpret hardware manuals 
and documentation: you can do it yourself. Lastly, I wrote this 
book from an autodidact's perspective. I made this book as 
self-contained as possible so you can spend more time learning 
and less time guessing or seeking out information on the 
Internet.

One of the core focuses of this book is to guide you through the 
process of reading official documentation from vendors to 
implement your software. Official documents from hardware vendors 
like Intel are critical for implementing an operating system or 
any other software that directly controls the hardware. At a 
minimum, an operating system developer needs to be able to 
comprehend these documents and implement software based on a set 
of hardware requirements. Thus, the first chapter is dedicated to 
discussing relevant documents and their importance.

Another distinct feature of this book is that it is “Hello World” 
centric. Most examples revolve around variants of a “Hello World” 
program. Most examples revolve around variants of a “Hello World” 
program, which will acquaint you with core concepts. These 
concepts must be learned before attempting to write an operating 
system. Anything beyond a simple “Hello World” example gets in 
the way of teaching the concepts, thus lengthening the time spent 
on getting started writing an operating system. 

Let's dive in. With this book, I hope to provide enough 
foundational knowledge that will open doors for you to make sense 
of other resources. This book is will be especially beneficial to 
students who've just finished their first C/C++ course. Imagine 
how cool it would be to show prospective employers that you've 
already built an operating system.

  Prerequisites

• Basic knowledge of circuits

  – Basic Concepts of Electricity: atoms, electrons, proton, 
    neutron, current flow.

  – Ohm's law

  If you are unfamiliar with these concepts, you can quickly 
  learn them here: http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/, by 
  reading chapter 1 and chapter 2.

• C programming. In particular:

  – Variable and function declarations/definitions

  – While and for loops

  – Pointers and function pointers

  – Fundamental algorithms and data structures in C

• Linux basics: 

  – Know how to navigate directory with the command line

  – Know how to invoke a command with options

  – Know how to pipe output to another program

• Touch typing. Since we are going to use Linux, touch typing 
  helps. I know typing speed does not relate to problem-solving, 
  but at least your typing speed should be fast enough not to let 
  it get it the way and degrade the learning experience.

In general, I assume that the reader has basic C programming 
knowledge, and can use an IDE to build and run a program.

  What you will learn in this book 

• How to write an operating system from scratch by reading 
  hardware datasheets. In the real world, you will not be able to 
  consult Google for a quick answer. 

• Write code independently. It's pointless to copy and paste 
  code. Real learning happens when you solve problems on your 
  own. Some examples are provided to help kick start your work, 
  but most problems are yours to conquer. However, the solutions 
  are available online for you after giving a good try.

• A big picture of how each layer of a computer related to each 
  other, from hardware to software.

• How to use Linux as a development environment and common tools 
  for low-level programming.

• How a program is structured so that an operating system can 
  run.

• How to debug a program running directly on hardware with gdb 
  and QEMU.

• Linking and loading on bare metal x86_64, with pure C. No 
  standard library. No runtime overhead.

  What this book is not about

• Electrical Engineering: The book discusses some concepts from 
  electronics and electrical engineering only to the extent of 
  how software operates on bare metal.

• How to use Linux or any OS types of books: Though Linux is used 
  as a development environment and as a medium to demonstrate 
  high-level operating system concepts, it is not the focus of 
  this book.

• Linux Kernel development: There are already many high-quality 
  books out there on this subject.

• Operating system books focused on algorithms: This book focuses 
  more on actual hardware platform - Intel x86_64 - and how to 
  write an OS that utilizes of OS support from the hardware 
  platform.

  The organization of the book

  Part 1 provides a foundation for learning operating system.

  • Chapter 1 briefly explains the importance of domain 
    documents. Documents are crucial for the learning experience, 
    so they deserve a chapter.

  • Chapter 2 explains the layers of abstractions from hardware 
    to software. The idea is to provide insight into how code 
    runs physically.

  • Chapter 3 provides the general architecture of a computer, 
    then introduces a sample computer model that you will use to 
    write an operating system.

  • Chapter 4 introduces the x86 assembly language through the 
    use of the Intel manuals, along with commonly used 
    instructions. This chapter gives detailed examples of how 
    high-level syntax corresponds to low-level assembly, enabling 
    you to read generated assembly code comfortably. It is 
    necessary to read assembly code when debugging an operating 
    system.

  • Chapter 5 dissects ELF in detail. Only by understanding how 
    the structure of a program at the binary level, you can build 
    one that runs on bare metal.

  • Chapter 6 introduces gdb debugger with extensive examples for 
    commonly used commands. After acquainting the reader with 
    gdb, it then provides insight on how a debugger works. This 
    knowledge is essential for building a debuggable program on 
    the bare metal. 

  Part 2 presents how to write a bootloader to bootstrap a 
  kernel. Hence the name “Groundwork”. After mastering this part, 
  the reader can either continue with the next part that is a 
  guide on writing an operating system. However, if the reader 
  does not like the presentation, he or she can look elsewhere, 
  such as OSDev Wiki: http://wiki.osdev.org/. 

  • Chapter 7 introduces what the bootloader is, how to write one 
    in assembly, and how to load it on QEMU, a hardware emulator. 
    This process involves typing repetitive and long commands, so 
    GNU Make is applied to improve productivity by automating the 
    repetitive parts and simplifying the interaction with the 
    project. This chapter also demonstrates the use of GNU Make 
    in context.

  • Chapter 8 introduces linking by explaining the relocation 
    process when combining object files. In addition to a 
    bootloader and an operating system written in C, this is the 
    last piece of the puzzle required for building debuggable 
    programs on bare metal, including the bootloader written in 
    Assembly and an operating system written in C.

  Part 3 provides guidance on how to write an operating system, 
  as you should implement an operating system on your own and be 
  proud of your creation. The guidance consists of simpler and 
  coherent explanations of necessary concepts, from hardware to 
  software, to implement the features of an operating system. 
  Without such guidance, you will waste time gathering 
  information spread through various documents and the Internet. 
  It then provides a plan on how to map the concepts to code.

Preliminary

Domain documents

  Problem domains

In the real world, software engineering is not only focused on 
software, but also the problem domain it is trying to solve. 

A problem domain[margin:
problem domain
]problem domain is the part of the world where the computer is to 
produce effects, together with the means available to produce 
them, directly or indirectly. (Kovitz, 1999)

A problem domainproblem domain is anything outside of programming 
that a software engineer needs to understand to produce correct 
code that can achieve the desired effects. “Directly” means 
include anything that the software can control to produce the 
desired effects, e.g. keyboards, printers, monitors, other 
software... “Indirectly” means anything not part of the software 
but relevant to the problem domain e.g. appropriate people to be 
informed by the software when some event happens, students that 
move to correct classrooms according to the schedule generated by 
the software. To write a finance application, a software engineer 
needs to learn sufficient finance concepts to understand the [margin:
requirements
]requirementsrequirements of a customer and implement such 
requirements, correctly.

Requirements are the effects that the machine is to exert in the 
problem domain by virtue of its programming.

Programming alone is not too complicated; programming to solve a 
problem domain, is [footnote:
We refer to the concept of “programming” here as someone able to 
write code in a language, but not necessary know any or all 
software engineering knowledge.
]. Not only a software engineer needs to understand how to 
implement the software, but also the problem domain that it tries 
to solve, which might require in-depth expert knowledge. The 
software engineer must also select the right programming 
techniques that are apply to the problem domain he is trying to 
solve because many techniques that are effective in one domain 
might not be in another. For example, many types of applications 
do not require performant written code, but a short time to 
market. In this case, interpreted languages are widely popular 
because it can satisfy such need. However, for writing huge 3D 
games or operating system, compiled languages are dominant 
because it can generate the most efficient code required for such 
applications.

Often, it is too much for a software engineer to learn 
non-trivial domains (that might require a bachelor degree or 
above to understand the domains). Also, it is easier for a domain expert
domain expert to learn enough programming to break down the 
problem domain into parts small enough for the software engineers 
to implement. Sometimes, domain experts implement the software 
themselves.

[Figure 0.1:
Problem domains: Software and Non-software.
]

     <Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/01/domains_general.pdf>
     
]

One example of such scenario is the domain that is presenting in 
this book: operating system. A certain amount of electrical 
engineering (EE) knowledge is required to implement an operating 
system. If a computer science (CS) curriculum that does not 
include minimum EE courses, students in the curriculum have 
little chance to implement a working operating system. Even if 
they can implement one, either they need to invest a significant 
amount of time to study on their own, or they fill code in a 
predefined framework just to understand high-level algorithms. 
For that reason, EE students have an easier time to implement an 
OS, as they only need to study a few core CS courses. In fact, 
only “C programming” and “Algorithms and Data Structures” classes 
are usually enough to get them start writing code for device 
drivers, and later generalize it into an operating system.

Operating System domain.

     <Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/01/domains_os_example.pdf>
     
]

One thing to note is that software is its own problem domain. A 
problem domain does not necessarily divide between software and 
itself. Compilers, 3D graphics, games, cryptography, artificial 
intelligence, etc., are parts of software engineering domains 
(actually it is more of a computer science domain than a software 
engineering domain). In general, a software-exclusive domain 
creates software to be used by other software. Operating System 
is also a domain, but is overlapped with other domain such as 
electrical engineering. To effectively implement an operating 
system, it is required to learn enough of the external domain. 
How much learning is enough for a software engineer? At the 
minimum, a software engineer should be knowledgeable enough to 
understand the documents prepared by hardware engineers for using 
(i.e. programming) their devices.

Learning a programming language, even C or Assembly, does not 
mean a software engineer can automatically be good at hardware 
programming or any related low-level programming domains. One can 
spend 10 years, 20 years or his entire life writing C/C++ code, 
and he still cannot write an operating system, simply because of 
the ignorant of relevant domain knowledge. Just like learning 
English does not mean a person automatically becomes good at 
reading Math books written in English. Much more than that is 
needed. Knowing one or two programming languages is not enough. 
If a programmer writes software for a living, he should better be 
specialized in one or two problem domains outside of software if 
he does not want his job taken by domain experts who learn 
programming in their spare time.

  Documents for implementing a problem domain

Documents are essential for learning a problem domain (and 
actually, anything) since information can be passed down in a 
reliable way. It is evident that this written text has been used 
for thousands of years to pass knowledge from generations to 
generations. Documents are integral parts of non-trivial 
projects. Without the documents:

• New people will find it much harder to join a project.

• It is harder to maintain a project because people may forget 
  important unresolved bugs or quirks in their system.

• It is challenging for customers to understand the product they 
  are going to use. However, documents do not need to be written 
  in book format. It can be anything from HTML format to database 
  format to be displayed by a graphical user interface. Important 
  information must be stored somewhere safe, readily accessible.

There are many types of documents. However, to facilitate the 
understanding of a problem domain, these two documents need to be 
written: software requirement document and software 
specification. 

  Software Requirement Document

Software requirement document[margin:
Software requirement
]Software requirement document includes both a list of 
requirements and a description of the problem domain (Kovitz, 1999)
.

A software solves a business problem. But, which problems to 
solve, are requested by a customer. Many of these requests make a 
list of requirements that our software needs to fulfill. However, 
an enumerated list of features is seldom useful in delivering 
software. As stated in the previous section, the tricky part is 
not programming alone but programming according to a problem 
domain. The bulk of software design and implementation depends 
upon the knowledge of the problem domain. The better understood 
the domain, the higher quality software can be. For example, 
building a house is practiced over thousands of years and is well 
understood, and it is easy to build a high-quality house; 
software is no difference. Code that is difficult to understand, 
usually because of the ignorance of problem domain. In the 
context of this book, we sought to understand the low-level 
working of various hardware devices.

Because software quality depends upon the understandings of the 
problem domain, the amount of software requirement document 
should consist of problem domain description.

Be aware that software requirements are not:

  What vs How

  “what” and “how” are vague terms. What is the “what”? Is it 
  nouns only? If so, what if a customer requires his software to 
  perform specific steps of operations, such as purchasing 
  procedure for a customer on a website. Does it include “verbs” 
  now? However, isn't the “how” supposed to be step by step 
  operations? Anything can be the “what” and anything can be the “
  how”. 

  Sketches

  Software requirement document is all about the problem domain. 
  It should not be a high-level description of an implementation. 
  Some problems might seem straightforward to map directly from 
  its domain description to the structure of an implementation. 
  For example:

  • Users are given a list of books in a drop-down menu to 
    choose. 

  • Books are stored in a linked list”. 

  • ...

  In the future, instead of a drop-down menu, all books are 
  listed directly on a page in thumbnails. Books might be 
  reimplemented as a graph, and each node is a book for finding 
  related books, as a recommender is going to be added in the 
  next version. The requirement document needs updating again to 
  remove all the outdated implementation details, thus required 
  additional efforts to maintain the requirement document, and 
  when the effort for syncing with the implementation is too 
  much, the developers give up documentation, and everyone starts 
  ranting how useless documentation is. 

  More often than not there is no straightforward one-to-one 
  mapping. For example, a regular computer user expects OS to be 
  something that runs some program with GUI, or their favorite 
  computer games. But for such requirements, an operating system 
  is implemented as multiple layers, each hides the details from 
  the upper layers. To implement an operating system, a large 
  body of knowledge from multiple fields are required, especially 
  if the operating system runs on non-PC devices. 

  It's better to put anything related to the problem domain in 
  the requirement document. A good way to test the quality of 
  requirement document is to hand it to the domain expert for 
  proofreading if he can understand the material thoroughly. 
  Requirement document is also useful as a help document later, 
  or for writing one much easier.

  Software Specification

Software specification[margin:
Software specification
]Software specification document states rules relating desired 
behavior of the output devices to all possible behavior of the 
input devices, as well as any rules that other parts of the 
problem domain must obey.Kovitz (1999)

Simply put, software specification is interface design, with 
constraints for the problem domain to follow e.g. the software 
can accept certain types of input such as the software is 
designed to accept English but no other language. For a hardware 
device, a specification is always needed, as software depends on 
its hardwired behaviors. And in fact, it is mostly the case that 
hardware specifications are well-defined, with the tiniest 
details in it. It needs to be that way because once hardware is 
physically manufactured, there's no going back, and if defects 
exist, it's a devastating damage to the company on both finance 
and reputation.

Note that, similar to a requirement document, a specification 
only concerns interface design. If implementation details leak 
in, it is a burden to sync between the actual implementation and 
the specification, and soon to be abandoned.

Another important remark is that, though a specification document 
is important, it does not have to be produced before the 
implementation. It can be prepared in any order: before or after 
a complete implementation; or at the same time with the 
implementation, when some part is done, and the interface is 
ready to be recorded in the specification. Regardless of methods, 
what matter is a complete specification at the end.

  Documents for writing an x86 Operating System

When problem domain is different from software domain, 
requirement document and specification are usually separated. 
However, if the problem domain is inside software, specification 
most often includes both, and content of both can be mixed with 
each other. As demonstrated by previous sections the importance 
of documents, to implement an OS, we will need to collects 
relevant documents to gain sufficient domain knowledge. These 
documents are as follow:

• Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual 
  (Volume 1, 2, 3)

• Intel® 3 Series Express Chipset Family Datasheet

• System V Application Binary Interface

Aside from the Intel's official website, the website of this book 
also hosts the documents for convenience[footnote:
Intel may change the links to the documents as they update their 
website, so this book doesn't contain any link to the documents 
to avoid confusion for readers.
].

Intel documents divide the requirement and specification sections 
clearly, but call the sections with different names. The 
corresponding to the requirement document is a section called “
Functional Description”, which consists mostly of domain 
description; for specification, “Register Description” section 
describes all programming interfaces. Both documents carry no 
unnecessary implementation details[footnote:
As it should be, those details are trade secret.
]. Intel documents are also great examples of how to write well 
requirements/specifications, as explained in this chapter.

Other than the Intel documents, other documents will be 
introduced in the relevant chapters.



This chapter gives an intuition on how hardware and software 
connected together, and how software is represented physically.

  The physical implementation of a bit

All electronic devices, from simple to complex, manipulate this 
flow to achieve desired effects in the real world. Computers are 
no exception. When we write software, we indirectly manipulate 
electrical current at the physical level, in such a way that the 
underlying machine produces desired effects. To understand the 
process, we consider a simple light bulb. A light bulb can change 
two states between on and off with a switch, periodically: an off 
means number 0, and an on means 1.[float MarginFigure:
[MarginFigure 1:
A lightbulb
]

<Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/02/bulb.svg>
]

However, one problem is that such a switch requires manual 
intervention from a human. What is required is an automatic 
switch based on the voltage level, as described above. To enable 
automatic switching of electrical signals, a device called 
transistor, invented by William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter 
Brattain. This invention started the whole computer industry. 

At the core, a [margin:
transistor
]transistortransistor is just a resistor whose values can vary 
based on an input voltage value[float MarginFigure:
[MarginFigure 2:
Modern transistor
]

<Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/02/transistor.svg>
]. With this property, a transistor can be used as a current 
amplifier (more voltage, less resistance) or switch electrical 
signals off and on (block and unblock an electron flow) based on 
a voltage level. At 0 v, no current can pass through a 
transistor, thus it acts like a circuit with an open switch 
(light bulb off) because the resistor value is enough to block 
the electrical flow. Similarly, at +3.5 v, current can flow 
through a transistor because the resistor value is lessened, 
effectively enables electron flow, thus acts like a circuit with 
a closed switch.[margin:
If you want a deeper explanation of transistors e.g. how 
electrons move, you should look at the video “How semiconductors 
work” on Youtube, by Ben Eater.
]

A bit has two states: 0 and 1, which is the building block of all 
digital systems and software. Similar to a light bulb that can be 
turned on and off, bits are made out of this electrical stream 
from the power source: Bit 0 are represented with 0 v (no 
electron flow), and bit 1 is +3.5 v to +5 v (electron flow). 
Transistor implements a bit correctly, as it can regulate the 
electron flow based on voltage level. 

  MOSFET transistors

The classic transistors invented open a whole new world of micro 
digital devices. Prior to the invention, vacuum tubes - which are 
just fancier light bulbs - were used to present 0 and 1, and 
required human to turn it on and off. [margin:
MOSFET
]MOSFETMOSFET, or Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect 
Transistor, invented in 1959 by Dawon Kahng and Martin M. (John) 
Atalla at Bell Labs, is an improved version of classic 
transistors that is more suitable for digital devices, as it 
requires shorter switching time between two states 0 and 1, more 
stable, consumes less power and easier to produce.

There are also two types of MOSFETs analogous to two types of 
transistors: n-MOSFET and p-MOSFET. n-MOSFET and p-MOSFET are 
also called NMOS and PMOS transistors for short.

  Beyond transistors: digital logic gates

All digital devices are designed with logic gates. A logic gate[margin:
logic gate
]logic gate is a device that implements a boolean function. Each 
logic gate includes a number of inputs and an output. All 
computer operations are built from the combinations of logic 
gates, which are just combinations of boolean functions. [float MarginFigure:
[MarginFigure 3:
Example: NAND gate
]

<Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/02/Nand-gate.svg>


]

  The theory behind logic gates

Logic gates accept only binary inputs[footnote:
Input that is either a 0 or 1.
] and produce binary outputs. In other words, logic gates are 
functions that transform binary values. Fortunately, a branch of 
math that deals exclusively with binary values already existed, 
called Boolean Algebra, developed in the 19[superscript:th]century by George Boole. With a sound mathematical theory as a 
foundation logic gates were created. As logic gates implement 
Boolean functions, a set of Boolean functions is functionally complete
[margin:
functionally complete
]functionally complete, if this set can construct all other 
Boolean functions can be constructed from. Later, Charles Sanders 
Peirce (during 1880 -- 1881) proved that either Boolean function 
of NOR or NAND alone is enough to create all other Boolean logic 
functions. Thus NOR and NAND gates are functionally complete Peirce (1933)
. Gates are simply the implementations of Boolean logic 
functions, therefore NAND or NOR gate is enough to implement all 
other logic gates. The simplest gates CMOS circuit can implement 
are inverters (NOT gates) and from the inverters, comes NAND 
gates. With NAND gates, we are confident to implement everything 
else. This is why the inventions of transistors, then CMOS 
circuit revolutionized computer industry.[margin:
If you want to understand why and how from NAND gate we can 
create all Boolean functions and a computer, I suggest the course 
Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to 
Tetris available on Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer
. Go even further, after the course, you should take the series 
Computational Structures on Edx.
]

We should realize and appreciate how powerful boolean functions 
are available in all programming languages.

  Logic Gate implementation: CMOS circuit

Underlying every logic gate is a circuit called [margin:
CMOS
]CMOSCMOS - Complementary MOSFET. CMOS consists of two 
complementary transistors, NMOS and PMOS. The simplest CMOS 
circuit is an inverter or a NOT gate:










From NOT gate, a NAND gate can be created:



From NAND gate, we have all other gates. As demonstrated, such a 
simple circuitry performs the logical operators in day-to-day 
program languages e.g. NOT operator ~ is executed directly by an 
inverter circuit, and operator & is executed by an AND circuit 
and so on. Code does not run on magic a black box. In contrast, 
code execution is precise and transparent, often as simple as 
running some hardwired circuit. When we write software, we simply 
manipulate electrical current at the physical level to run 
appropriate circuits to produce desired outcomes. However, this 
whole process somehow does not relate to any thought involving 
electrical current. That is the real magic and will be explained 
soon.

One interesting property of CMOS is that a k-input gate uses k 
PMOS and k NMOS transistors (Wakerly, 1999). All logic gates are 
built by pairs of NMOS and PMOS transistors, and gates are the 
building blocks of all digital devices from simple to complex, 
including any computer. Thanks to this pattern, it is possible to 
separate between the actual physical circuit implementation and 
logical implementation. Digital designs are done by designing 
with logic gates then later be “compiled” into physical circuits. 
In fact, later we will see that logic gates become a language 
that describes how circuits operate. Understanding how CMOS works 
is important to understand how a computer is designed, and as a 
consequence, how a computer works[footnote:
Again, if you want to understand how logic gates make a computer, 
consider the suggested courses on Coursera and Edx earlier. 
].

Finally, an implemented circuit with its wires and transistors is 
stored physically in a package called a chip. A chipchip is a 
substrate that an integrated circuit is etched onto. However, a 
chip also refers to a completely packaged integrated circuit in 
consumer market. Depends on the context, it is understood 
differently.[float MarginFigure:


[MarginFigure 4:
74HC00 chip physical view

<Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/02/74hc00_nxp_physical.jpg>
]


-------------------------------------------


74HC00 is a chip with four 2-input NAND gates. The chip comes 
with 8 input pins and 4 output pins, 1 pin for connecting to a 
voltage source and 1 pin for connecting to the ground. This 
device is the physical implementation of NAND gates that we can 
physically touch and use. But instead of just a single gate, the 
chip comes with 4 gates that can be combined. Each combination 
enables a different logic function, effective creating other 
logic gates. This feature is what make the chip popular.

]

  Each of the gates above is just a simple NAND circuit with the 
  electron flows, as demonstrated earlier. Yet, many these 
  NAND-gates chips combined can build a simple computer. 
  Software, at the physical level, is just electron flows.

  

  How can the above gates can be created with 74HC00? It is 
  simple: as every gate has 2 input pins and 1 output pin, we can 
  write the output of 1 NAND gate to an input of another NAND 
  gate, thus chaining NAND gates together to produce the diagrams 
  as above.


-------------------------------------------


  Beyond Logic Gates: Machine Language

  Machine language

Being built upon gates, as gates only accept a series of 0 and 1, 
a hardware device only understands 0 and 1. However, a device 
only takes 0 and 1 in a systematic way. [margin:
Machine language
]Machine languageMachine language is a collection of unique bit 
patterns that a device can identify and perform a corresponding 
action. A machine instruction is a unique bit pattern that a 
device can identify. In a computer system, a device with its 
language is called CPU - Central Processing Unit, which controls 
all activities going inside a computer. For example, in the x86 
architecture, the pattern 10100000 means telling a CPU to add two 
numbers, or 000000101 to halt a computer. In the early days of 
computers, people had to write completely in binary.

Why does such a bit pattern cause a device to do something? The 
reason is that underlying each instruction is a small circuit 
that implements the instruction. Similar to how a 
function/subroutine in a computer program is called by its name, 
a bit pattern is a name of a little function inside a CPU that 
got executed when the CPU finds one.

Note that CPU is not the only device with its language. CPU is 
just a name to indicate a hardware device that controls a 
computer system. A hardware device may not be a CPU but still has 
its language. A device with its own machine language is a 
programmable device, since a user can use the language to command 
the device to perform different actions. For example, a printer 
has its set of commands for instructing it how to prints a page.


-------------------------------------------


<exa:74HC00-chip-can>A user can use 74HC00 chip without knowing 
its internal, but only the interface for using the device. First, 
we need to know its layout:

Then, the functionality of each pin:

]

  [margin:
• n is a number, either 1, 2, 3, or 4

• H = HIGH voltage level; L = LOW voltage level; X = don’t care.
]The functional description provides a truth table with all 
  possible pin inputs and outputs, which also describes the usage 
  of all pins in the device. A user needs not to know the 
  implementation, but on such a table to use the device. We can 
  say that the truth table above is the machine language of the 
  device. Since the device is digital, its language is a 
  collection of binary strings:

  • The device has 8 input pins, and this means it accepts binary 
    strings of 8 bits.

  • The device has 4 output pins, and this means it produces 
    binary strings of 4 bits from the 8-bit inputs.

  The number of input strings is what the device understand, and 
  the number of output strings is what the device can speak. 
  Together, they make the language of the device. Even though 
  this device is simple, yet the language it can accept contains 
  quite many binary strings: 2^{8}+2^{4}=272
. However, the 
  number is a tiny fraction of a complex device like a CPU, with 
  hundreds of pins.

  When leaving as is, 74HC00 is simply a NAND device with two 
  4-bit inputs[footnote:
Or simply 4-bit NAND gate, as it can only accept 4 bits of input 
at the maximum.
].

  On the other hand, if OR gate is implemented, we can only build 
  a 2-input OR gate from 74HC00, as it requires 3 NAND gates: 2 
  input NAND gates and 1 output NAND gate. Each input NAND gate 
  represents only a 1-bit input of the OR gate. In the following 
  figure, the pins of each input NAND gates are always set to the 
  same values (either both inputs are A or both inputs are B) to 
  represent a single bit input for the final OR gate:

To implement a 4-bit OR gate, we need a total of four of 74HC00 
chips configured as OR gates, packaged as a single chip as in 
figure [or-chip-74hc00].

  Assembly Language

Assembly language is the symbolic representation of binary 
machine code, by giving bit patterns mnemonic names. It was a 
vast improvement when programmers had to write 0 and 1. For 
example, instead of writing 000000101, a programmer simply write 
hlt to stop a computer. Such an abstraction makes instructions 
executed by a CPU easier to remember, and thus more instructions 
could be memorized, less time spent looking up CPU manual to find 
instructions in bit forms and as a result, code was written 
faster.

Understand assembly language is crucial for low-level programming 
domains, even to this day. The more instructions a programmer 
want to understand, the deeper understanding of machine 
architecture is required.

We can build a device with 2 assembly instructions:

  or   <op1>, <op2>

  nand <op1>, <op2>

  • or accepts two 4-bit operands. This corresponds to a 4-input 
    OR gate device built from 4 74HC00 chips.

  • nand accepts two 4-bit operands. This corresponds to a single 
    74HC00 chips, leave as is.

  Essentially, the gates in the example [exa:74HC00-chip-can] 
  implements the instructions. Up to this point, we only specify 
  input and output and manually feed it to a device. That is, to 
  perform an operation:

  • Pick a device by hands.

  • Manually put electrical signals into pins.

  First, we want to automate the process of device selection. 
  That is, we want to simply write assembly instruction and the 
  device that implements the instruction is selected correctly. 
  Solving this problem is easy:

  • Give each instruction an index in binary code, called 
    operation code or opcode for short, and embed it as part of 
    input. The value for each instruction is specified as in 
    table [ex-ins-ops].[float MarginTable:
[MarginTable 1:
Instruction-Opcode mapping.
]<ex-ins-ops>


+--------------+-------------+
| Instruction  | Binary Code |
+--------------+-------------+
+--------------+-------------+
|    nand      |     00      |
+--------------+-------------+
|     or       |     01      |
+--------------+-------------+

]

    Each input now contains additional data at the beginning: an 
    opcode. For example, the instruction:

    nand 1100, 1100

    corresponds to the binary string: 0011001100. The first two 
    bits 00 encodes a nand instruction, as listed in the table 
    above.

  • Add another device to select a device, based on a binary code 
    peculiar to an instruction. 

  Such a device is called a decoder, an important component in a 
  CPU that decides which circuit to use. In the above example, 
  when feeding 0011001100 to the decoder, because the opcode is 
  00, data are sent to NAND device for computing.

  Finally, writing assembly code is just an easier way to write 
  binary strings that a device can understand. When we write 
  assembly code and save in a text file, a program called an [margin:
assembler
]assemblerassembler translates the text file into binary strings 
  that a device can understand. So, how can an assembler exist in 
  the first place? Assume this is the first assembler in the 
  world, then it is written in binary code. In the next version, 
  life is easier: the programmers write the assembler in the 
  assembly code, then use the first version to compile itself. 
  These binary strings are then stored in another device that 
  later can be retrieved and sent to a decoder. A storage device[margin:
storage device
]storage device is the device that stores machine instructions, 
  which is an array of circuits for saving 0 and 1 states.

  A decoder is built out of logic gates similar to other digital 
  devices. However, a storage device can be anything that can 
  store 0 and 1 and is retrievable. A storage device can be a 
  magnetized device that uses magnetism to store information, or 
  it can be made out of electrical circuits using. Regardless of 
  the technology used, as long as the device can store data and 
  is accessible to retrieve data, it suffices. Indeed, the modern 
  devices are so complex that it is impossible and unnecessary to 
  understand every implementation detail. Instead, we only need 
  to learn the interfaces, e.g. the pins, that the devices 
  expose.

  



  


  A computer essentially implements this process: 

  • Fetch an instruction from a storage device.

  • Decode the instruction.

  • Execute the instruction.

  Or in short, a fetch -- decode -- executefetch -- decode -- 
  execute cycle. The above device is extremely rudimentary, but 
  it already represents a computer with a fetch -- decode -- 
  execute cycle. More instructions can be implemented by adding 
  more devices and allocating more opcodes for the instructions, 
  then update the decoder accordingly. The Apollo Guidance 
  Computer, a digital computer produced for the Apollo space 
  program from 1961 -- 1972, was built entirely with NOR gates - 
  the other choice to NAND gate for creating other logic gates. 
  Similarly, if we keep improving our hypothetical device, it 
  eventually becomes a full-fledge computer.

  Programming Languages

Assembly language is a step up from writing 0 and 1. As time goes 
by, people realized that many pieces of assembly code had 
repeating patterns of usages. It would be nice if instead of 
writing all the repeating blocks of code all over again in all 
places, we simply refer to such blocks of code with easier to use 
text forms. For example, a block of assembly code checks whether 
one variable is greater than another and if so, execute a block 
of code, else execute another block of code; in C, such block of 
assembly code is represented by an if statement that is close to 
human language.

People created text forms to represent common blocks of assembly 
code, such as the if syntax above, then write a program to 
translate the text forms into assembly code. The program that 
translates such text forms to machine code is called a [margin:

Any software logic a programming language can implement, hardware 
can also implement. The reverse is also true: any hardware logic 
that is implemented in a circuit can be reimplemented in a 
programming language. The simple reason is that programming 
languages, or assembly languages, or machine languages, or logic 
gates are just languages to express computations. It is 
impossible for software to implement something hardware is 
incapable of because programming language is just a simpler way 
to use the underlying hardware. At the end of the day, 
programming languages are translated to machine instructions that 
are valid to a CPU. Otherwise, code is not runnable, thus a 
useless software. In reverse, software can do everything hardware 
(that run the software) can, as programming languages are just an 
easier way to use the hardware.

In reality, even though all languages are equivalent in power, 
not all of them are capable of express programs of each other. 
Programming languages vary between two ends of a spectrum: high 
level and low level. 

The higher level a programming language is, the distant it 
becomes with hardware. In some high-level programming languages, 
such as Python, a programmer cannot manipulate underlying 
hardware, despite being able to deliver the same computations as 
low-level programming languages. The reason is that high-level 
languages want to hide hardware details to free programmers from 
dealing with irrelevant details not related to current problem 
domains. Such convenience, however, is not free: it requires 
software to carry an extra code for managing hardware details 
(e.g. memory) thus making the code run slower, and it makes 
hardware programming difficult or impossible. The more 
abstractions a programming language imposes, the more difficult 
it is for writing low-level software, such as hardware drivers or 
an operating system. This is the reason why C is usually a 
language of choice for writing an operating system, since C is 
just a thin wrapper of the underlying hardware, making it easy to 
understand how exactly a hardware device runs when executing a 
certain piece of C code.

Each programming language represents a way of thinking about 
programs. Higher-level programming languages help to focus on 
problem domains that are not related to hardware at all, and 
where programmer performance is more important than computer 
performance. Lower-level programming languages help to focus on 
the inner-working of a machine, thus are best suited for problem 
domains that are related to control hardware. That is why so many 
languages exist. Use the right tools for the right job to achieve 
the best results.



  Abstraction

AbstractionAbstraction is a technique for hiding complexity that 
is irrelevant to the problem in context. For example, writing 
programs without any other layer except the lowest layer: with 
circuits. Not only a person needs an in-depth understanding of 
how circuits work, making it much more obscure to design a 
circuit because the designer must look at the raw circuits but 
think in higher-level such as logic gates. It is a distracting 
process, as a designer must constantly translate the idea into 
circuits. It is possible for a designer simply thinks his 
high-level ideas straight, and later translate the ideas into 
circuits. Not only it is more efficient, but it is also more 
accurate as a designer can focus all his efforts into verifying 
the design with high-level thinking. When a new designer arrives, 
he can easily understand the high-level designs, thus can 
continue to develop or maintain existing systems.

  Why abstraction works

In all the layers, abstractions manifest itself:

• Logic gates abstract away the details of CMOS.

• Machine language abstracts away the details of logic gates.

• Assembly language abstracts away the details of machine 
  languages.

• Programming language abstracts away the details of assembly 
  languages.

We see repeating patterns of how lower-layers build upper-layers:

• A lower layer has a recurring pattern. Then, this recurring 
  pattern is taken out and built a language on top of it.

• A higher layer strips away layer-specific (non-recurring) 
  details to focus on the recurring details.

• The recurring details are given a new and simpler language than 
  the languages of the lower layers. 

What to realize is that every layer is just a more convenient 
language to describe the lower layer. Only after a description is 
fully created with the language of the higher layer, it is then 
be implemented with the language of the lower layer.

• CMOS layer has a recurring pattern that makes sure logic gates 
  are reliably translated to CMOS circuits: a k-input gate uses k 
  PMOS and k NMOS transistors (Wakerly, 1999). Since digital 
  devices use CMOS exclusively, a language arose to describe 
  higher level ideas while hiding CMOS circuits: Logic Gates.

• Logic Gates hides the language of circuits and focuses on how 
  to implement primitive Boolean functions and combine them to 
  create new functions. All logic gates receive input and 
  generate output as binary numbers. Thanks to this recurring 
  patterns, logic gates are hidden away for the new language: 
  Assembly, which is a set of predefined binary patterns that 
  cause the underlying gates to perform an action.

• Soon, people realized that many recurring patterns arisen from 
  within Assembly language. Repeated blocks of Assembly code 
  appear in Assembly source files that express the same or 
  similar idea. There were many such ideas that can be reliably 
  translated into Assembly code. Thus, the ideas were extracted 
  for building into the high level programming languages that 
  everyone programmer learns today.

Recurring patterns are the key to abstraction. Recurring patterns 
are why abstraction works. Without them, no language can be 
built, and thus no abstraction. Fortunately, human already 
developed a systematic discipline for studying patterns: 
Mathematics. As quoted from the British mathematician G. H. Hardy 
(2005):

A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of 
patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is 
because they are made with ideas.

Isn't that a mathematical formula a representation of a pattern? 
A variable represents values with the same properties given by 
constraints? Mathematics provides a formal system to identify and 
describe existing patterns in nature. For that reason, this 
system can certainly be applied in the digital world, which is 
just a subset of the real world. Mathematics can be used as a 
common language to help translation between layers easier, and 
help with the understanding of layers.



  Why abstraction reduces complexity

Abstraction by building language certainly leverages productivity 
by stripping irrelevant details to a problem. Imagine writing 
programs without any other layout except the lowest layer: with 
circuits. This is how complexity emerges: when high-level ideas 
are expressed with lower-level language, as the example above 
demonstrated. Unfortunately, this is the case with software as 
programming languages at the moment are more emphasized on 
software rather than the problem domains. That is, without prior 
knowledge, code written in a language is unable to express itself 
the knowledge of its target domain. In other words, a language is 
expressive if its syntax is designed to express the problem 
domain it is trying to solve. Consider this example: That is, the 
what it will do rather the how it will do.


-------------------------------------------


Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/) is a visualization software 
that provides a language, called dot, for describing graph:

  

  As can be seen, the code perfectly expresses itself how the 
  graph is connected. Even a non-programmer can understand and 
  use such language easily. If it were to implement in C, it 
  would be more troublesome, and this is assuming that the 
  functions for drawing graphs are already available. To draw a 
  line, in C we might write something like:

  draw_line(a, b);

  However, it is still verbose compared with:

  a -> b;

  Also, a and b must be defined in C, compared to the implicit 
  nodes in the dot language. However, if we do not factor in the 
  verbosity, then C still has a limitation: it cannot change its 
  syntax to suit the problem domain. A domain-specific language 
  might even be more verbose, but it makes a domain more 
  understandable. If a problem domain must be expressed in C, 
  then it is constraint by the syntax of C. Since C is not a 
  specialized language for a problem domain that, but is a 
  general-purpose programming language, the domain knowledge is 
  buried within the implementation details. As a result, a C 
  programmer is needed to decipher and extract the domain 
  knowledge out. If the domain knowledge cannot be extracted, 
  then the software cannot be further developed.



Linux is full of applications controlled by many domain-specific 
languages and are placed in /etc directory, such as a web server. 
Instead of reprogramming the software, a domain-agnostic language 
is made for it.


-------------------------------------------


In general, code that can express a problem domain must be 
understandable by a domain expert. Even within the software 
domain, building a language out of repeated programming patterns 
is useful. It helps people aware the existence of such patterns 
in code and thus making software easier to maintain, as software 
structure is visible as a language. Only a programming language 
that is capable of morphing itself to suit a problem domain can 
achieve that goal. Such language is called a programmable 
programming language. Unfortunately, this approach of turning 
software structure visible is not favored among programmers, as a 
new language must be made out of it along with new toolchain to 
support it. Thus, software structure and domain knowledge are 
buried within code written in the syntax of a general-purpose 
language, and if a programmer is not familiar or even aware of 
the existence of a code pattern, then it is hopeless to 
understand the code. A prime example is reading C code that 
controls hardware, e.g. an operating system: if a programmer 
knows absolutely nothing about hardware, then it is impossible to 
read and write operating system code in C, even if he could have 
20 years of writing application C code.

With abstraction, a software engineer can also understand the 
inner-working of a device without specialized knowledge of 
physical circuit design, enables the software engineer to write 
code that controls a device. The separation between logical and 
physical implementation also entails that gate designs can be 
reused even when the underlying technologies changed. For 
example, in some distant future biological computer could be a 
reality, and gates might not be implemented as CMOS but some kind 
of biological cells e.g. as living cells; in either technology: 
electrical or biological, as long as logic gates are physically 
realized, the same computer design could be implemented.

Computer Architecture

To write lower level code, a programmer must understand the 
architecture of a computer. It is similar to when one writes 
programs in a software framework, he must know what kinds of 
problems the framework solves, and how to use the framework by 
its provided software interfaces. But before getting to the 
definition of what computer architecture is, we must understand 
what exactly is a computer, as many people still think that a 
computer is a regular computer we put on a desk, or at best, a 
server. Computers come in various shapes and sizes and are 
devices that people never imagine they are computers, and that 
code can run on such devices. 

  What is a computer?

A [margin:
computer
]computercomputer is a hardware device that consists of at least 
a processor (CPU), a memory device and input/output interfaces. 
All the computers can be grouped into two types:

  Single-purpose computer is a computer built at the hardware 
  level for specific tasks. For example, dedicated application 
  encoders/decoders , timer, image/video/sound processors.

  General-purpose computer is a computer that can be programmed 
  (without modifying its hardware) to emulate various features of 
  single-purpose computers.

  Server

A server[margin:

resources to provide large-scale services for a broad audience. 
The audience are people with their personal computer connected to 
a server.

  Desktop Computer

A [margin:

with an input and output system designed for a human user, with 
moderate resources enough for regular use. The input system 
usually includes a mouse and a keyboard, while the output system 
usually consists of a monitor that can display a large mount of 
pixels. The computer is enclosed in a chassis large enough for 
putting various computer components such as a processor, a 
motherboard, a power supply, a hard drive, etc.

  Mobile Computer

resources but can be carried around.



  Game Consoles

Game consoles are similar to desktop computers but are optimized 
for gaming. Instead of a keyboard and a mouse, the input system 
of a game console are game controllers, which is a device with a 
few buttons for controlling on-screen objects; the output system 
is a television. The chassis is similar to a desktop computer but 
is smaller. Game consoles use custom processors and graphic 
processors but are similar to ones in desktop computers. For 
example, the first Xbox uses a custom Intel Pentium III 
processor.



Handheld game consoles are similar to game consoles, but 
incorporate both the input and output systems along with the 
computer in a single package.

integrating into larger hardware devices. [float MarginFigure:

A [margin:
microcontroller
]microcontrollerMicrocontroller is an embedded computer designed 
for controlling other hardware devices. A microcontroller is 
mounted on a chip. Microcontrollers are general-purpose 
computers, but with limited resources so that it is only able to 
perform one or a few specialized tasks. These computers are used 
for a single purpose, but they are still general-purpose since it 
is possible to program them to perform different tasks, depends 
on the requirements, without changing the underlying hardware.

Another type of embedded computer is system-on-chip. A 
system-on-chipsystem-on-chip is a full computer on a single chip. 
Though a microcontroller is housed on a chip, its purpose is 
different: to control some hardware. A microcontroller is usually 
simpler and more limited in hardware resources as it specializes 
only in one purpose when running, whereas a system-on-chip is a 
general-purpose computer that can serve multiple purposes. A 
system-on-chip can run like a regular desktop computer that is 
capable of loading an operating system and run various 
applications. A system-on-chip typically presents in a 
smartphone, such as Apple A5 SoC used in Ipad2 and iPhone 4S, or 
Qualcomm Snapdragon used in many Android phones.[float MarginFigure:

]

Be it a microcontroller or a system-on-chip, there must be an 
environment where these devices can connect to other devices. 
This environment is a circuit board called a PCBPCB -- Printed Circuit Board
Printed Circuit Board. A printed circuit boardPrinted Circuit Board
 is a physical board that contains lines and pads to enable 
electron flows between electrical and electronics components. 
Without a PCB, devices cannot be combined to create a larger 
device. As long as these devices are hidden inside a larger 
device and contribute to a larger device that operates at a 
higher level layer for a higher level purpose, they are embedded 
devices. Writing a program for an embedded device is therefore 
called embedded programmingembedded programming. Embedded 
computers are used in automatically controlled devices including 
power tools, toys, implantable medical devices, office machines, 
engine control systems, appliances, remote controls and other 
types of embedded systems.



The line between a microcontroller and a system-on-chip is 
blurry. If hardware keeps evolving more powerful, then a 
microcontroller can get enough resources to run a minimal 
operating system on it for multiple specialized purposes. In 
contrast, a system-on-chip is powerful enough to handle the job 
of a microcontroller. However, using a system-on-chip as a 
microcontroller would not be a wise choice as price will rise 
significantly, but we also waste hardware resources since the 
software written for a microcontroller requires little computing 
resources.

  Field Gate Programmable Array

[margin:
Field Programmable Gate Array
]Field Programmable Gate ArrayField Gate Programmable Array (FPGA
FPGA) is a hardware an array of reconfigurable gates that makes 
circuit structure programmable after it is shipped away from the 
factory[footnote:
This is why it is called Field Gate Programmable Array. It is 
changeable “in the field” where it is applied.
]. Recall that in the previous chapter, each 74HC00 chip can be 
configured as a gate, and a more sophisticated device can be 
built by combining multiple 74HC00 chips. In a similar manner, 
each FPGA device contains thousands of chips called logic blocks, 
which is a more complicated chip than a 74HC00 chip that can be 
configured to implement a Boolean logic function. These logic 
blocks can be chained together to create a high-level hardware 
feature. This high-level feature is usually a dedicated algorithm 
that needs high-speed processing.

Digital devices can be designed by combining logic gates, without 
regarding actual circuit components, since the physical circuits 
are just multiples of CMOS circuits. Digital hardware, including 
various components in a computer, is designed by writing code, 
like a regular programmer, by using a language to describe how 
gates are wired together. This language is called a Hardware 
Description LanguageHardware Description Language. Later the 
hardware description is compiled to a description of connected 
electronic components called a netlistnetlist, which is a more 
detailed description of how gates are connected.

The difference between FPGA and other embedded computers is that 
programs in FPGA are implemented at the digital logic level, 
while programs in embedded computers like microcontrollers or 
system-on-chip devices are implemented at assembly code level. An 
algorithm written for a FPGA device is a description of the 
algorithm in logic gates, which the FPGA device then follows the 
description to configure itself to run the algorithm. An 
algorithm written for a microcontroller is in assembly 
instructions that a processor can understand and act accordingly. 

FPGA is applied in the cases where the specialized operations are 
unsuitable and costly to run on a regular computer such as 
real-time medical image processing, cruise control system, 
circuit prototyping, video encoding/decoding, etc. These 
applications require high-speed processing that is not achievable 
with a regular processor because a processor wastes a significant 
amount of time in executing many non-specialized instructions - 
which might add up to thousands of instructions or more - to 
implement a specialized operation, thus more circuits at physical 
level to carry the same operation. A FPGA device carries no such 
overhead; instead, it runs a single specialized operation 
implemented in hardware directly.

  Application-Specific Integrated Circuit

An Application-Specific Integrated CircuitApplication-Specific 
Integrated Circuit (or ASICASIC) is a chip designed for a 
particular purpose rather than for general-purpose use. ASIC does 
not contain a generic array of logic blocks that can be 
reconfigured to adapt to any operation like an FPGA; instead, 
every logic block in an ASIC is made and optimized for the 
circuit itself. FPGA can be considered as the prototyping stage 
of an ASIC, and ASIC as the final stage of circuit production. 
ASIC is even more specialized than FPGA, so it can achieve even 
higher performance. However, ASICs are very costly to manufacture 
and once the circuits are made, if design errors happen, 
everything is thrown away, unlike the FPGA devices which can 
simply be reprogrammed because of the generic gate array.

  Computer Architecture

The previous section examined various classes of computers. 
Regardless of shapes and sizes, every computer is designed for an 
architect from high level to low level.

Computer\,Architecture=Instruction\,Set\,Architecture+Computer\,Organization+Hardware


At the highest-level is the Instruction Set Architecture.

At the middle-level is the Computer Organization.

At the lowest-level is the Hardware.

  Instruction Set Architecture

An instruction setinstruction set is the basic set of commands 
and instructions that a microprocessor understands and can carry 
out. 

An Instruction Set ArchitectureInstruction Set Architecture, or ISA
ISA, is the design of an environment that implements an 
instruction set. Essentially, a runtime environment similar to 
those interpreters of high-level languages. The design includes 
all the instructions, registers, interrupts, memory models (how 
memory are arranged to be used by programs), addressing modes, 
I/O... of a CPU. The more features (e.g. more instructions) a CPU 
has, the more circuits are required to implement it. 

  Computer organization

[margin:
Computer organization
]Computer organizationComputer organization is the functional 
view of the design of a computer. In this view, hardware 
components of a computer are presented as boxes with input and 
output that connects to each other and form the design of a 
computer. Two computers may have the same ISA, but different 
organizations. For example, both AMD and Intel processors 
implement x86 ISA, but the hardware components of each processor 
that make up the environments for the ISA are not the same.

Computer organizations may vary depend on a manufacturer's 
design, but they are all originated from the Von Neumann 
architecture[footnote:
John von Neumann was a mathematician and physicist who invented a 
computer architecture.

]

  CPUCPU fetches instructions continuously from main memory and 
  execute.

  MemoryMemory stores program code and data.

  BusBus are electrical wires for sending raw bits between the 
  above components.

  I/O DevicesI/O Devices are devices that give input to a 
  computer i.e. keyboard, mouse, sensor... and takes the output 
  from a computer i.e. monitor takes information sent from CPU to 
  display it, LED turns on/off according to a pattern computed by 
  CPU...

The Von-Neumann computer operates by storing its instructions in 
main memory, and CPU repeatedly fetches those instructions into 
its internal storage for executing, one after another. Data are 
transferred through a data bus between CPU, memory and I/O 
devices, and where to store in the devices is transferred through 
the address bus by the CPU. This architecture completely 
implements the fetch -- decode -- executefetch -- decode -- 
execute cycle.

The earlier computers were just the exact implementations of the 
Von Neumann architecture, with CPU and memory and I/O devices 
communicate through the same bus. Today, a computer has more 
buses, each is specialized in a type of traffic. However, at the 
core, they are still Von Neumann architecture. To write an OS for 
a Von Neumann computer, a programmer needs to be able to 
understand and write code that controls the cores components: 
CPU, memory, I/O devices, and bus.

CPUCPU, or Central Processing UnitCentral Processing Unit, is the 
heart and brain of any computer system. Understand a CPU is 
essential to writing an OS from scratch:

• To use these devices, a programmer needs to controls the CPU to 
  use the programming interfaces of other devices. CPU is the 
  only way, as CPU is the only direct device a programmer can use 
  and the only device that understand code written by a 
  programmer.

• In a CPU, many OS concepts are already implemented directly in 
  hardware, e.g. task switching, paging. A kernel programmer 
  needs to know how to use the hardware features, to avoid 
  duplicating such concept in software, thus wasting computer 
  resources.

• CPU built-in OS features boost both OS performance and 
  developer productivity because those features are actual 
  hardware, the lowest possible level, and developers are free to 
  implement such features.

• To effectively use the CPU, a programmer needs to understand 
  the documentation provided from CPU manufacturer. For example, [[http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html||Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals]
  .

• After understanding one CPU architecture well, it is easier to 
  learn other CPU architectures.

A CPU is an implementation of an ISA, effective the 
implementation of an assembly language (and depends on the CPU 
architecture, the language may vary). Assembly language is one of 
the interfaces that are provided for software engineers to 
control a CPU, thus control a computer. But how can every 
computer device be controlled with only the access to the CPU? 
The simple answer is that a CPU can communicate with other 
devices through these two interfaces, thus commanding them what 
to do:

  Registers Registers[margin:
Registers
]are a hardware component for high-speed data access and 
  communication with other hardware devices. Registers allow 
  software to control hardware directly by writing to registers 
  of a device, or receive information from hardware device when 
  reading from registers of a device.

  Not all registers are used for communication with other 
  devices. In a CPU, most registers are used as high-speed 
  storage for temporary data. Other devices that a CPU can 
  communicate always have a set of registers for interfacing with 
  the CPU. 

  Port Port[margin:
Port
]is a specialized register in a hardware device used for 
  communication with other devices. When data are written to a 
  port, it causes a hardware device to perform some operation 
  according to values written to the port. The different between 
  a port and a register is that port does not store data, but 
  delegate data to some other circuit.

These two interfaces are extremely important, as they are the 
only interfaces for controlling hardware with software. Writing 
device drivers is essentially learning the functionality of each 
register and how to use them properly to control the device.

[margin:
Memory
]MemoryMemory is a storage device that stores information. Memory 
consists of many cells. Each cell is a byte with its address 
number, so a CPU can use such address number to access an exact 
location in memory. Memory is where software instructions (in the 
form of machine language) is stored and retrieved to be executed 
by CPU; memory also stores data needed by some software. Memory 
in a Von Neumann machine does not distinguish between which bytes 
are data and which bytes are software instructions. It's up to 
the software to decide, and if somehow data bytes are fetched and 
executed as instructions, CPU still does it if such bytes 
represents valid instructions, but will produce undesirable 
results. To a CPU, there's no code and data; both are merely 
different types of data for it to act on: one tells it how to do 
something in a specific manner, and one is necessary materials 
for it to carry such action.

The RAM is controlled by a device called a memory controllermemory controller
. Currently, most processors have this device embedded, so the 
CPU has a dedicated memory bus connecting the processor to the 
RAM. On older CPU[footnote:
Prior to the CPU's produced in 2009
], however, this device was located in a chip also known as MCH 
or Memory Controller HubMemory Controller Hub. In this case, the 
CPU does not communicate directly to the RAM, but to the MCH 
chip, and this chip then accesses the memory to read or write 
data. The first option provides better performance since there is 
no middleman in the communications between the CPU and the 
memory.



At the physical level, RAM is implemented as a grid of cells that 
each contain a transistor and an electrical device called a [margin:
capacitor
]capacitorcapacitor, which stores charge for short periods of 
time. The transistor controls access to the capacitor; when 
switched on, it allows a small charge to be read from or written 
to the capacitor. The charge on the capacitor slowly dissipates, 
requiring the inclusion of a refresh circuit to periodically read 
values from the cells and write them back after amplification 
from an external power source.

Bus[margin:
Bus
]Bus is a subsystem that transfers data between computer 
components or between computers. Physically, buses are just 
electrical wires that connect all components together and each 
wire transfer a single big of data. The total number of wires is 
called bus width[margin:

]bus width, and is dependent on how many wires a CPU can support. 
If a CPU can only accept 16 bits at a time, then the bus has 16 
wires connecting from a component to the CPU, which means the CPU 
can only retrieve 16 bits of data a time.

  Hardware

Hardware is a specific implementation of a computer. A line of 
processors implement the same instruction set architecture and 
use nearly identical organizations but differ in hardware 
implementation. For example, the Core i7 family provides a model 
for desktop computers that is more powerful but consumes more 
energy, while another model for laptops is less performant but 
more energy efficient. To write software for a hardware device, 
seldom we need to understand a hardware implementation if 
documents are available. Computer organization and especially the 
instruction set architecture are more relevant to an operating 
system programmer. For that reason, the next chapter is devoted 
to study the x86 instruction set architecture in depth.

  x86 architecture

A chipsetchipset is a chip with multiple functions. Historically, 
a chipset is actually a set of individual chips, and each is 
responsible for a function, e.g. memory controller, graphic 
controllers, network controller, power controller, etc. As 
hardware progressed, the set of chips were incorporated into a 
single chip, thus more space, energy, and cost efficient. In a 
desktop computer, various hardware devices are connected to each 
other through a PCB called a motherboardmotherboard. Each CPU 
needs a compatible motherboard that can host it. Each motherboard 
is defined by its chipset model that determine the environment 
that a CPU can control. This environment typically consists of 

• a slot or more for CPU

• a chipset of two chips which are the Northbridge and 
  Southbridge chips

  – Northbridge chip is responsible for the high-performance 
    communication between CPU, main memory and the graphic card. 

  – Southbridge chip is responsible for the communication with 
    I/O devices and other devices that are not performance 
    sensitive.

• slots for memory sticks

• a slot or more for graphic cards. 

• generic slots for other devices, e.g. network card, sound card.

• ports for I/O devices, e.g. keyboard, mouse, USB.

]

To write a complete operating system, a programmer needs to 
understand how to program these devices. After all, an operating 
system manages hardware automatically to free application 
programs doing so. However, of all the components, learning to 
program the CPU is the most important, as it is the component 
present in any computer, regardless of what type a computer is. 
For this reason, the primary focus of this book will be on how to 
program an x86 CPU. Even solely focused on this device, a 
reasonably good minimal operating system can be written. The 
reason is that not all computers include all the devices as in a 
normal desktop computer. For example, an embedded computer might 
only have a CPU and limited internal memory, with pins for 
getting input and producing an output; yet, operating systems 
were written for such devices. 

However, learning how to program an x86 CPU is a daunting task, 
with 3 primary manuals written for it: almost 500 pages for 
volume 1, over 2000 pages for volume 2 and over 1000 pages for 
volume 3. It is an impressive feat for a programmer to master 
every aspect of x86 CPU programming.

  Intel Q35 Chipset

Q35 is an Intel chipset released September 2007. Q35 is used as 
an example of a high-level computer organization because later we 
will use QEMU to emulate a Q35 system, which is latest Intel 
system that QEMU can emulate. Though released in 2007, Q35 is 
relatively modern to the current hardware, and the knowledge can 
still be reused for current chipset model. With a Q35 chipset, 
the emulated CPU is also relatively up-to-date with features 
presented in current day CPUs so we can use the latest software 
manuals from Intel.

Figure [mobo-organization] is a typical current-day motherboard 
organization, in which Q35 shares similar organization.

  x86 Execution Environment

An execution environmentexecution environment is an environment 
that provides the facility to make code executable. The execution 
environment needs to address the following question:

• Supported operations? data transfer, arithmetic, control, 
  floating-point...

• Where are operands stored? registers, memory, stack, 
  accumulator

• How many explicit operands are there for each instruction? 0, 
  1, 2, or 3

• How is the operand location specified? register, immediate, 
  indirect, . . .

• What type and size of operands are supported? byte, int, float, 
  double, string, vector...

• etc.

For the remain of this chapter, please carry on the reading to 
chapter 3 in Intel Manual Volume 1, “Basic Execution Environment” 
.

x86 Assembly and C

In this chapter, we will explore assembly language, and how it 
connects to C. But why should we do so? Isn't it better to trust 
the compiler, plus no one writes assembly anymore? 

Not quite. Surely, the compiler at its current state of the art 
is trustworthy, and we do not need to write code in assembly, 
most of the time. A compiler can generate code, but as mentioned 
previously, a high-level language is a collection of patterns of 
a lower-level language. It does not cover everything that a 
hardware platform provides. As a consequence, not every assembly 
instruction can be generated by a compiler, so we still need to 
write assembly code for these circumstances to access 
hardware-specific features. Since hardware-specific features 
require writing assembly code, debugging requires reading it. We 
might spend even more time reading than writing. Working with 
low-level code that interacts directly with hardware, assembly 
code is unavoidable. Also, understand how a compiler generates 
assembly code could improve a programmer's productivity. For 
example, if a job or school assignment requires us to write 
assembly code, we can simply write it in C, then let gcc does the 
hard working of writing the assembly code for us. We merely 
collect the generated assembly code, modify as needed and be done 
with the assignment.

We will learn objdump extensively, along with how to use Intel 
documents to aid in understanding x86 assembly code.

  objdump

objdumpobjdump is a program that displays information about 
object files. It will be handy later to debug incorrect layout 
from manual linking. Now, we use objdump to examine how high 
level source code maps to assembly code. For now, we ignore the 
output and learn how to use the command first. It is simple to 
use objdump :



$ objdump -d hello



-d option only displays assembled contents of executable 
sections. A sectionsection is a block of memory that contains 
either program code or data. A code section is executable by the 
CPU, while a data section is not executable. Non-executable 
sections, such as .data and .bss (for storing program data), 
debug sections... are not displayed. We will learn more about 
section when studying ELF binary file format in chapter [chap:The-Anatomy-of-a-program]
 . On the other hand:



$ objdump -D hello



where -D option displays assembly contents of all sections. If -D
, -d is implicitly assumed. objdump is mostly used for inspecting 
assembly code, so -d is the most useful and thus is set by 
default.

The output overruns the terminal screen. To make it easy for 
reading, send all the output to less:



$ objdump -d hello | less



To intermix source code and assembly, the binary must be compiled 
with -g option to include source code in it, then add -S option:



$ objdump -S hello | less



The default syntax used by objdump is AT&T syntax. To change it 
to the familiar Intel syntax:



$ objdump -M intel -D hello | less



When using -M option, option -D or -d must be explicitly 
supplied. Next, we will use objdump to examine how compiled C 
data and code are represented in machine code.

Finally, we will write a 32-bit kernel, therefore we will need to 
compile a 32-bit binary and examine it in 32-bit mode:



$ objdump -M i386,intel -D hello | less



-M i386 tells objdump to display assembly content using 32-bit 
layout. Knowing the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit is 
crucial for writing kernel code. We will examine this matter 
later on when writing our kernel.

  Reading the output

At the start of the output displays the file format of the object 
file:

hello: file format elf64-x86-64

After the line is a series of disassembled sections:

Disassembly of section .interp:

...

Disassembly of section .note.ABI-tag:

...

Disassembly of section .note.gnu.build-id:

...

...

etc

Finally, each disassembled section displays its actual content - 
which is a sequence of assembly instructions - with the following 
format:

4004d6:       55                      push   rbp

• The first column is the address of an assembly instruction. In 
  the above example, the address is 0x4004d6.

• The second column is assembly instruction in raw hex values. In 
  the above example, the address is 0x55.

• The third column is the assembly instruction. Depends on the 
  section, the assembly instruction might be meaningful or 
  meaningless. For example, if the assembly instructions are in a 
  .text section, then the assembly instructions are actual 
  program code. On the other hand, if the assembly instructions 
  are displayed in a .data section, then we can safely ignore the 
  displayed instructions. The reason is that objdump doesn't know 
  which hex values are code and which are data, so it blindly 
  translates every hex values into assembly instructions. In the 
  above example, the assembly instruction is push %rbp. 

• The optional fourth column is a comment - appears when there is 
  a reference to an address - to inform where the address 
  originates. For example, the comment in blue:

      lea    r12,[rip+0x2008ee]        # 600e10 
  <__frame_dummy_init_array_entry>

  is to inform that the referenced address from [rip+0x2008ee] is 
  0x600e10, where the variable __frame_dummy_init_array_entry 
  resides.

In a disassembled section, it may also contain labels. A label is 
a name given to an assembly instruction. The label denotes the 
purpose of an assembly block to a human reader, to make it easier 
to understand. For example, .text section carries many of such 
labels to denote where code in a program start; .text section 
below carries two functions: _start and deregister_tm_clones. The 
_start function starts at address 4003e0, is annotated to the 
left of the function name. Right below _start label is also the 
instruction at address 4003e0. This whole thing means that a 
label is simply a name of a memory address. The function 
deregister_tm_clones also shares the same format as every 
function in the section.

00000000004003e0 <_start>:

  4003e0:       31 ed                   xor    ebp,ebp

  4003e2:       49 89 d1                mov    r9,rdx

  4003e5:       5e                      pop    rsi

...more assembly code....



0000000000400410 <deregister_tm_clones>:

  400410:       b8 3f 10 60 00          mov    eax,0x60103f

  400415:       55                      push   rbp

  400416:       48 2d 38 10 60 00       sub    rax,0x601038

...more assembly code....

  Intel manuals

The best way to understand and use assembly language properly is 
to understand precisely the underlying computer architecture and 
what each machine instruction does. To do so, the most reliable 
source is to refer to documents provided by vendors. After all, 
hardware vendors are the one who made their machines. To 
understand Intel's instruction set, we need the document “Intel 
64 and IA-32 architectures software developer's manual combined 
volumes 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D: Instruction set reference, A-Z”. The 
document can be retrieved here: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-sdm
.

• Chapter 1 provides brief information about the manual, and the 
  comment notations used in the book.

• Chapter 2 provides an in-depth explanation of the anatomy of an 
  assembly instruction, which we will investigate in the next 
  section.

• Chapter 3 - 5 provide the details of every instruction of the 
  x86_64 architecture.

• Chapter 6 provides information about safer mode extensions. We 
  won't need to use this chapter.

The first volume “Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software 
Developer’s Manual Volume 1: Basic Architecture” describes the 
basic architecture and programming environment of Intel 
processors. In the book, Chapter 5 gives the summary of all Intel 
instructions, by listing instructions into different categories. 
We only need to learn general-purpose instructions listed chapter 
5.1 for our OS. Chapter 7 describes the purpose of each category. 
Gradually, we will learn all of these instructions.

Read section 1.3 in volume 2, exclude sections 1.3.5 and 1.3.7.

  Experiment with assembly code 

The subsequent sections examine the anatomy of an assembly 
instruction. To fully understand, it is necessary to write code 
and see the code in its actual form displayed as hex numbers. For 
this purpose, we use nasm assembler to write a few line of 
assembly code and see the generated code.


-------------------------------------------


Suppose we want to see the machine code generated for this 
instruction:

  jmp eax

  Then, we use an editor e.g. Emacs, then create a new file, 
  write the code and save it in a file, e.g. test.asm. Then, in 
  the terminal, run the command: 

  

  $ nasm -f bin test.asm -o test

  

  -f option specifies the file format, e.g. ELF, of the final 
  output file. But in this case, the format is bin, which means 
  this file is just a flat binary output without any extra 
  information. That is, the written assembly code is translated 
  to machine code as is, without the overhead of the metadata 
  from file format like ELF. Indeed, after compiling, we can 
  examine the output using this command:

  

  $ hd test

  

  hd (short for hexdump) is a program that displays the content 
  of a file in hex format[margin:
Though its name is short for hexdump, hd can display in different 
base, e.g. binary, other than hex. 
]. And get the following output:

  00000000  66 ff e0                          |f..|

  00000003

  The file only consists of 3 bytes: 66 ff e0, which is 
  equivalent to the instruction jmp eax. 


-------------------------------------------




If we were to use elf as file format:

  

  $ nasm -f elf test.asm -o test

  

  It would be more challenging to learn and understand assembly 
  instructions with all the added noise[footnote:
The output from hd.

  Thus, it is better just to use flat binary format in this case, 
  to experiment instruction by instruction.

With such a simple workflow, we are ready to investigate the 
structure of every assembly instruction.

Note: Using the bin format puts nasm by default into 16-bit mode. 
To enable 32-bit code to be generated, we must add this line at 
the beginning of an nasm source file:

  Anatomy of an Assembly Instruction

Chapter 2 of the instruction reference manual provides an 
in-depth of view of instruction format. But, the information is 
too much that it can overwhelm beginners. This section provides 
an easier instruction before reading the actual chapter in the 
manual.





<Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/04/x86_instruction_format.pdf>



Recall that an assembly instruction is simply a fixed-size series 
of bits. The length of an instruction varies and depends on how 
complicated an instruction is. What every instruction shares is a 
common format described in the figure above that divides the bits 
of an instruction into smaller parts that encode different types 
of information. These parts are:

  Instruction Prefixes appears at the beginning of an 
  instruction. Prefixes are optional. A programmer can choose to 
  use a prefix or not because in practice, a so-called prefix is 
  just another assembly instruction to be inserted before another 
  assembly instruction that such prefix is applicable. 
  Instructions with 2 or 3-bytes opcodes include the prefixes by 
  default.

  Opcode is a unique number that identifies an instruction. Each 
  opcode is given an mnemonic name that is human readable, e.g. 
  one of the opcodes for instruction add is 04. When a CPU sees 
  the number 04 in its instruction cache, it sees instruction add 
  and execute accordingly. Opcode can be 1,2 or 3 bytes long and 
  includes an additional 3-bit field in the ModR/M byte when 
  needed.

  This instruction:

  jmp [0x1234]

  generates the machine code:

  ff 26 34 12

  The very first byte, 0xff is the opcode, which is unique to jmp 
  instruction.

  ModR/M specifies operands of an instruction. Operand can either 
  be a register, a memory location or an immediate value. This 
  component of an instruction consists of 3 smaller parts:

  • mod field, or modifier field, is combined with r/m field for 
    a total of 5 bits of information to encode 32 possible 
    values: 8 registers and 24 addressing modes.

  • reg/opcode field encodes either a register operand, or 
    extends the Opcode field with 3 more bits.

  • r/m field encodes either a register operand or can be 
    combined with mod field to encode an addressing mode.

  The tables [mod-rm-16] and [mod-rm-32] list all possible 256 
  values of ModR/M byte and how each value maps to an addressing 
  mode and a register, in 16-bit and 32-bit modes.

  1. The [-][-] nomenclature means a SIB follows the ModR/M byte.

2. The disp32 nomenclature denotes a 32-bit displacement that 
  follows the ModR/M byte (or the SIB byte if one is present) and 
  that is added to the index.

3. The disp8 nomenclature denotes an 8-bit displacement that 
  follows the ModR/M byte (or the SIB byte if one is present) and 
  that is sign-extended and added to the index.                                          
<mod-rm-32>










How to read the table:

In an instruction, next to the opcode is a ModR/M byte. Then, 
look up the byte value in this table to get the corresponding 
operands in the row and column.


-------------------------------------------


An instruction uses this addressing mode:

  jmp [0x1234]

  Then, the machine code is:

  ff 26 34 12

  0xff is the opcode. Next to it, 0x26 is the ModR/M byte. Look 
  up in the 16-bit table [margin:
Remember, using bin format generates 16-bit code by default
], the first operand is in the row, equivalent to a disp16, which 
  means a 16-bit offset. Since the instruction does not have a 
  second operand, the column can be ignored.

  An instruction uses this addressing mode:

  add eax, ecx

  Then the machine code is:

  01 c8

  0x01 is the opcode. Next to it, c8 is the ModR/M byte. Look up 
  in the 16-bit table at c8 value, the row tells the first 
  operand is ax [margin:
Remember, using bin format generates 16-bit code by default
], the column tells the second operand is cx; the column can't be 
  ignored as the second operand is in the instruction.

  Why is the first operand in the row and the second in a column? 
  Let's break down the ModR/M byte, with an example value c8, 
  into bits:

  
+----------+---------------------+-------------+
  |   mod    |     reg/opcode      |     r/m     |
  +----------+---------------------+-------------+
  +----+-----+----+----+-----------+----+----+---+
  | 1  | 1   | 0  | 0  |    1      | 0  | 0  | 0 |
  +----+-----+----+----+-----------+----+----+---+
  

  The mod field divides addressing modes into 4 different 
  categories. Further combines with the r/m field, exactly one 
  addressing mode can be selected from one of the 24 rows. If an 
  instruction only requires one operand, then the column can be 
  ignored. Then the reg/opcode field finally provides the if an 
  instruction requires one.


-------------------------------------------


  SIB is Scale-Index-Base byte. This byte encodes ways to 
  calculate the memory position into an element of an array. SIB 
  is the name that is based on this formula for calculating an 
  effective address:

  \mathtt{Effective\,address=scale*index+base}


  • Index is an offset into an array.

  • Scale is a factor of Index. Scale is one of the values 1, 2, 
    4 or 8; any other value is invalid. To scale with values 
    other than 2, 4 or 8, the scale factor must be set to 1, and 
    the offset must be calculated manually. For example, if we 
    want to get the address of the n[superscript:th] element in an array and each element is 12-bytes long. Because 
    each element is 12-bytes long instead of 1, 2, 4 or 8, Scale 
    is set to 1 and a compiler needs to calculate the offset:

    \mathtt{Effective\,address=1*(12*n)+base}


    Why do we bother with SIB when we can manually calculate the 
    offset? The answer is that in the above scenario, an 
    additional mul instruction must be executed to get the 
    offset, and the mul instruction consumes more than 1 byte, 
    while the SIB only consumes 1 byte. More importantly, if the 
    element is repeatedly accessed many times in a loop, e.g. 
    millions of times, then an extra mul instruction can 
    detriment the performance as the CPU must spend time 
    executing millions of these additional mul instructions. 

    The values 2, 4 and 8 are not random chosen. They map to 
    16-bit (or 2 bytes), 32-bit (or 4 bytes) and 64-bit (or 8 
    bytes) numbers that are often used for intensive numeric 
    calculations.

  • Base is the starting address.

  Below is the table listing all 256 values of SIB byte, with the

  This instruction:

    jmp [eax*2 + ebx]

    generates the following code:

    00000000  67 ff 24 43

    First of all, the first byte, 0x67 is not an opcode but a 
    prefix. The number is a predefined prefix for address-size 
    override prefix. After the prefix, comes the opcode 0xff and 
    the ModR/M byte 0x24. The value from ModR/M suggests that 
    there exists a SIB byte that follows. The SIB byte is 0x43. 

    Look up in the SIB table, the row tells that eax is scaled by 
    2, and the column tells that the base to be added is in ebx.

  Displacement is the offset from the start of the base index. 

  This instruction:

    jmp [0x1234]

    generates machine code is:

    ff 26 34 12      

    0x1234, which is generated as 34 12 in raw machine code, is 
    the displacement and stands right next to 0x26, which is the 
    ModR/M byte. 

    This instruction:

      jmp [eax * 4  + 0x1234]

    generates the machine code:

    67 ff 24 8d 34 12 00 00

    • 0x67 is an address-size override prefix. Its meaning is 
      that if an instruction runs a default address size e.g. 
      16-bit, the use of prefix enables the instruction to use 
      non-default address size, e.g. 32-bit or 64-bit. Since the 
      binary is supposed to be 16-bit, 0x67 changes the 
      instruction to 32-bit mode.

    • 0xff is the opcode.

    • 0x24 is the ModR/M byte. The value suggests that a SIB byte 
      follows, according to table [mod-rm-32].

    • 34 12 00 00 is the displacement. As can be seen, the 
      displacement is 4 bytes in size, which is equivalent to 
      32-bit, due to address-size override prefix.

  Immediate When an instruction accepts a fixed value, e.g. 
  0x1234, as an operand, this optional field holds the value. 
  Note that this field is different from displacement: the value 
  is not necessary used an offset, but an arbitrary value of 
  anything. 

  This instruction:

    mov eax, 0x1234

    generates the code:

    66 b8 34 12 00 00

    • 0x66 is operand-sized override prefix. Similar to 
      address-size override prefix, this prefix enables 
      operand-size to be non-default.

    • 0xb8 is one of the opcodes for mov instruction.

    • 0x1234 is the value to be stored in register eax. It is 
      just a value for storing directly into a register, and 
      nothing more. On the other hand, displacement value is an 
      offset for some address calculation.

  Skim through section 5.1 in volume 1. Read chapter 7 in volume

  segmentation, don't worry as the terms will be explained in 
  later chapters or ignored.

  Understand an instruction in detail

In the instruction reference manual (Volume 2), from chapter 3 
onward, every x86 instruction is documented in detail. Whenever 
the precise behavior of an instruction is needed, we always 
consult this document first. However, before using the document, 
we must know the writing conventions first. Every instruction has 
the following common structure for organizing information:

  Opcode table lists all possible opcodes of an assembly 
  instruction.

  Each table contains the following fields, and can have one or 
  more rows:

  
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Opcode    Instruction    Op/En    64/32-bit Mode    CPUID
Feature flag    Description |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  

  Opcode shows a unique hexadecimal number assigned to an 
    instruction. There can be more than one opcode for an 
    instruction, each encodes a variant of the instruction. For 
    example, one variant requires one operand, but another 
    requires two. In this column, there can be other notations 
    aside from hexadecimal numbers. For example, /r indicates 
    that the ModR/M byte of the instruction contains a reg 
    operand and an r/m operand. The detail listing is in section 
    3.1.1.1 and 3.1.1.2 in the Intel's manual, volume 2.

  Instruction gives the syntax of the assembly instruction that a 
    programmer can use for writing code. Aside from the mnemonic 
    representation of the opcode, e.g. jmp, other symbols 
    represent operands with specific properties in the 
    instruction. For example, rel8 represents a relative address 
    from 128 bytes before the end of the instruction to 127 bytes 
    after the end of instruction; similarly rel16/rel32 also 
    represents relative addresses, but with the operand size of 
    16/32-bit instead of 8-bit like rel8. For a detailed listing, 
    please refer to section 3.1.1.3 of volume 2.

  Op/En is short for Operand/Encoding. An operand encoding 
    specifies how a ModR/M byte encodes the operands that an 
    instruction requires. If a variant of an instruction requires 
    operands, then an additional table named “Instruction Operand 
    Encoding” is added for explaining the operand encoding, with 
    the following structure:

    
+--------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+
    | Op/En  | Operand 1  | Operand 2  | Operand 3  | Operand 4 |
    +--------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+
    

    Most instructions require one to two operands. We make use of 
    these instructions for our OS and skip the instructions that 
    require three or four operands. The operands can be readable 
    or writable or both. The symbol (r) denotes a readable 
    operand, and (w) denotes a writable operand. For example, 
    when Operand 1 field contains ModRM:r/m (r), it means the 
    first operand is encoded in r/m field of ModR/M byte, and is 
    only readable. 

  64/32-bit mode indicates whether the opcode sequence is 
    supported in a 64-bit mode and possibly 32-bit mode.

  CPUID Feature Flag indicates indicate a particular CPU feature 
    must be available to enable the instruction. An instruction 
    is invalid if a CPU does not support the required feature.[margin:
In Linux, the command:

cat /proc/cpuinfo

lists the information of available CPUs and its features in flags 
field.
]

    Compat/Leg Mode Many instructions do not have this field, but 
      instead is replaced with Compat/Leg Mode, which stands for 
      Compatibility or Legacy Mode. This mode enables 64-bit 
      variants of instructions to run normally in 16 or 32-bit 
      mode. [float MarginTable:

  Description briefly explains the variant of an instruction in 
    the current row.

  Description specifies the purpose of the instructions and how 
  an instruction works in detail.

  Operation is pseudo-code that implements an instruction. If a 
  description is vague, this section is the next best source to 
  understand an assembly instruction. The syntax is described in 
  section 3.1.1.9 in volume 2.

  Flags affected lists the possible changes to system flags in 
  EFLAGS register. 

  Exceptions list the possible errors that can occur when an 
  instruction cannot run correctly. This section is valuable for 
  OS debugging. Exceptions fall into one of the following 
  categories:

• Protected Mode Exceptions

• Real-Address Mode Exception

• Virtual-8086 Mode Exception

• Floating-Point Exception

• SIMD Floating-Point Exception

• Compatibility Mode Exception

• 64-bit Mode Exception

For our OS, we only use Protected Mode Exceptions and 
Real-Address Mode Exceptions. The details are in section 3.1.1.13 
and 3.1.1.14, volume 2.

  Example: jmp instruction

Let's look at our good old jmp instruction. First, the opcode

<jmp-instruction>



Each row lists a variant of jmp instruction. The first column has 
the opcode EB cb, with an equivalent symbolic form jmp rel8. 
Here, rel8 means 128 bytes offset, counting from the end of the 
instruction. The end of an instruction is the next byte after the 
last byte of an instruction. To make it more concrete, consider 
this assembly code:

main:

  jmp main

  jmp main2

  jmp main

main2:

  jmp 0x1234

generates the machine code:

The first jmp main instruction is generated into eb fe and 
occupies the addresses 00 and 01; the end of the first jmp main 
is at address 02, past the last byte of the first jmp main which 
is located at the address 01. The value fe is equivalent to -2, 
since eb opcode uses only a byte (8 bits) for relative 
addressing. The offset is -2, and the end address of the first 
jmp main is 02, adding them together we get 00 which is the 
destination address for jumping to. 

Similarly, the jmp main2 instruction is generated into eb 02, 
which means the offset is +2; the end address of jmp main2 is at 
04, and adding together with the offset we get the destination 
address is 06, which is the start instruction marked by the label 
main2.

The same rule can be applied to rel16 and rel32 encoding. In the 
example code, jmp 0x1234 uses rel16 (which means 2-byte offset) 
and is generated into e9 2b 12. As the table [jmp-instruction] 
shows, e9 opcode takes a cw operand, which is a 2-byte offset 
(section 3.1.1.1, volume 2). Notice one strange issue here: the 
offset value is 2b 12, while it is supposed to be 34 12. There is 
nothing wrong. Remember, rel8/rel16/rel32 is an offset, not an 
address. A offset is a distance from a point. Since no label is 
given but a number, the offset is calculated from the start of a 
program. In this case, the start of the program is the address 
00, the end of jmp 0x1234 is the address 09[footnote:
which means 9 bytes was consumed, starting from address 0.
], so the offset is calculated as 0x1234 - 0x9 = 0x122b. That 
solved the mystery!

The jmp instructions with opcode FF /4 enable jumping to a near, 
absolute address stored in a general-purpose register or a memory 
location; or in short, as written in the description, absolute 
indirect. The symbol /4 is the column with digit 4 in table [mod-rm-16]
[footnote:
The column with the following fields:

AH

SP

ESP

M45

XMM4

4

100
]. For example:

jmp [0x1234]

is generated into:

ff 26 34 12

Since this is 16-bit code, we use table [mod-rm-16]. Looking up 
the table, ModR/M value 26 means disp16, which means a 16-bit 
offset from the start of current index[footnote:
Look at the note under the table.
], which is the base address stored in DS register. In this case, 
jmp [0x1234] is implicitly understood as jmp [ds:0x1234], which 
means the destination address is 0x1234 bytes away from the start 
of a data segment.

The jmp instruction with opcode FF /5 enables jumping to a far, 
absolute address stored in a memory location (as opposed to /4, 
which means stored in a register); in short, a far pointer. To 
generate such instruction, the keyword far is needed to tell nasm 
we are using a far pointer:

jmp far [eax]

is generated into:

67 ff 28

Since 28 is the value in the 5th column of the table [mod-rm-32][footnote:
Remember the prefix 67 indicates the instruction is used as 
32-bit. The prefix only added if the default environment is 
assumed as 16-bit when generating code by an assembler.
] that refers to [eax], we successfully generate an instruction 
for a far jump. After CPU runs the instruction, the program 
counter eip and code segment register cs is set to the memory 
address, stored in the memory location that eax points to, and 
CPU starts fetching code from the new address in cs and eip. To 
make it more concrete, here is an example:



     <Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/04/far_jmp_ex.pdf>
     



The far address consumes total of 6 bytes in size for a 16-bit 
segment and 32-bit address, which is encoded as m16:32 from the 
table [jmp-instruction]. As can be seen from the figure above, 
the blue part is a segment address, loaded into cs register with 
the value 0x5678; the red part is the memory address within that 
segment, loaded into eip register with the value 0x1234 and start 
executing from there. 

Finally, the jmp instructions with EA opcode jump to a direct 
absolute address. For example, the instruction:

jmp 0x5678:0x1234

is generated into:

ea 34 12 78 56

The address 0x5678:0x1234 is right next to the opcode, unlike FF 
/5 instruction that needs an indirect address in eax register.

We skip the jump instruction with REX prefix, as it is a 64-bit 
instruction. 



  Examine compiled data

In this section, we will examine how data definition in C maps to 
its assembly form. The generated code is extracted from .bss 
section. That means, the assembly code displayed has no[footnote:
Actually, code is just a type of data, and is often used for 
hijacking into a running program to execute such code. However, 
we have no use for it in this book.
], aside from showing that such a value has an equivalent 
assembly opcode that represents an instruction.

The code-assembly listing is not random, but is based on Chapter 
4 of Volume 1, “Data Type”. The chapter lists fundamental data 
types that x86 hardware operates on, and through learning the 
generated assembly code, it can be understood how close C maps 
its syntax to hardware, and then a programmer can see why C is 
appropriate for OS programming. The specific objdump command used 
in this section will be:



$ objdump -z -M intel -S -D <object file> | less



Note: zero bytes are hidden with three dot symbols: ... To show 
all the zero bytes, we add -z option.

  Fundamental data types

The most basic types that x86 architecture works with are based 
on sizes, each is twice as large as the previous one: 1 byte (8 
bits), 2 bytes (16 bits), 4 bytes (32 bits), 8 bytes (64 bits) 
and 16 bytes (128 bits).



<Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/04/fundamental_data_types.pdf>



These types are simplest: they are just chunks of memory at 
different sizes that enables CPU to access memory efficiently. 
From the manual, section 4.1.1, volume 1:

Words, doublewords, and quadwords do not need to be aligned in 
memory on natural boundaries. The natural boundaries for words, 
double words, and quadwords are even-numbered addresses, 
addresses evenly divisible by four, and addresses evenly 
divisible by eight, respectively. However, to improve the 
performance of programs, data structures (especially stacks) 
should be aligned on natural boundaries whenever possible. The 
reason for this is that the processor requires two memory 
accesses to make an unaligned memory access; aligned accesses 
require only one memory access. A word or doubleword operand that 
crosses a 4-byte boundary or a quadword operand that crosses an 
8-byte boundary is considered unaligned and requires two separate 
memory bus cycles for access.

Some instructions that operate on double quadwords require memory 
operands to be aligned on a natural boundary. These instructions 
generate a general-protection exception (#GP) if an unaligned 
operand is specified. A natural boundary for a double quadword is 
any address evenly divisible by 16. Other instructions that 
operate on double quadwords permit unaligned access (without 
generating a general-protection exception). However, additional 
memory bus cycles are required to access unaligned data from 
memory.

In C, the following primitive types (must include stdint.h) maps 
to the fundamental types:

gcc generates the variables byte, word, dword, qword, dqword1, 
dword2, written earlier, with their respective values highlighted 
in the same colors; variables of the same type are also 
highlighted in the same color. Since this is data section, the 
assembly listing carries no meaning. When byte is declared with 
uint8_t, gcc guarantees that the size of byte is always 1 byte. 
But, an alert reader might notice the 00 value next to the 12 
value in the byte variable. This is normal, as gcc avoid memory 
misalignment by adding extra padding bytespadding bytes. To make 
it easier to see, we look at readelf output of .data section:



$ readelf -x .data hello



the output is (the colors mark which values belong to which 
variables):

Hex dump of section '.data':

  0x00601020 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 ................

  0x00601030 12003412 78563412 efcdab89 67452301 ..4.xV4.....gE#.

  0x00601040 efcdab89 67452301 00000000 00000000 ....gE#.........

  0x00601050 00000000 00000000 efcdab89 67452301 ............gE#.

As can be seen in the readelf output, variables are allocated 
storage space according to their types and in the declared order 
by the programmer (the colors correspond the the variables). 
Intel is a little-endian machine, which means smaller addresses 
hold bytes with smaller values, larger addresses hold byte with 
larger values. For example, 0x1234 is displayed as 34 12; that 
is, 34 appears first at address 0x601032, then 12 at 0x601033. 
The decimal values within a byte is unchanged, so we see 34 12 
instead of 43 21. This is quite confusing at first, but you will 
get used to it soon.

Also, isn't it redundant when char type is always 1 byte already 
and why do we bother adding int8_t? The truth is, char type is 
not guaranteed to be 1 byte in size, but only the minimum of 1 
byte in size. In C, a byte is defined to be the size of a char, 
and a char is defined to be smallest addressable unit of the 
underlying hardware platform. There are hardware devices that the 
smallest addressable unit is 16 bit or even bigger, which means 
char is 2 bytes in size and a “byte” in such platforms is 
actually 2 units of 8-bit bytes.

Not all architectures support the double quadword type. Still, 
gcc does provide support for 128-bit number and generate code 
when a CPU supports it (that is, a CPU must be 64-bit). By 
specifying a variable of type __int128 or unsigned __int128, we 
get a 128-bit variable. If a CPU does not support 64-bit mode, 
gcc throws an error.

The data types in C, which represents the fundamental data types, 
are also called unsigned numbers. Other than numerical 
calculations, unsigned numbers are used as a tool for structuring 
data in memory; we will this application see later in the book, 
when various data structures are organized into bit groups.

In all the examples above, when the value of a variable with 
smaller size is assigned to a variable with larger size, the 
value easily fits in the larger variable. On the contrary, the 
value of a variable with larger size is assigned to a variable 
with smaller size, two scenarios occur: 

• The value is greater than the maximum value of the variable 
  with smaller layout, so it needs truncating to the size of the 
  variable and causing incorrect value.

• The value is smaller than the maximum value of the variable 
  with a smaller layout, so it fits the variable.

However, the value might be unknown until runtime and can be 
value, it is best not to let such implicit conversion handled by 
the compiler, but explicitly controlled by a programmer. 
Otherwise it will cause subtle bugs that are hard to catch as the 
erroneous values might rarely be used to reproduce the bugs.

  Pointer Data Types

Pointers are variables that hold memory addresses. x86 works with 
2 types of pointers:

  Near pointer is a 16-bit/32-bit offset within a segment, also 
  called effective address.

  Far pointer is also an offset like a near pointer, but with an 
  explicit segment selector.



     <Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/04/pointer_data_type.pdf>
     



C only provides near pointer, since far pointer is platform 
dependent, such as x86. In application code, you can assume that 
the address of current segment starts at 0, so the offset is 
actually any memory addres from 0 to the maximum address.

pointer p2 holds the address of the variable i. Note that both 
the pointers are 8 bytes in size (or 4-byte, if 32-bit).

  Bit Field Data Type

A bit fieldbit field is a contiguous sequence of bits. Bit fields 
allow data structuring at bit level. For example, a 32-bit data 
can hold multiple bit fields that represent multiples different 
pieces of information, such as bits 0-4 specifies the size of a 
data structure, bit 5-6 specifies permissions and so on. Data 
structures at the bit level are common for low-level programming.

The sample code creates 4 variables: ns, i, bf, bf2. The 
definition of normal_struct and bit_field structs both specify 4 
integers. bit_field specifies additional information next to its 
member name, separated by a colon, e.g. .data1 : 8. This extra 
information is the bit width of each bit group. It means, even 
though defined as an int, .data1 only consumes 8 bit of 
information. If additional data members are specified after 
.data1, two scenarios happen:

• If the new data members fit within the remaining bits after 
  .data, which are 24 bits[footnote:
Since .data1 is declared as an int, 32 bits are still allocated, 
but .data1 can only access 8 bits of information.
], then the total size of bit_field struct is still 4 bytes, or 
  32 bits.

• If the new data members don't fit, then the remaining 24 bits 
  (3 bytes) are still allocated. However, the new data members 
  are allocated brand new storages, without using the previous 24 
  bits.

In the example, the 4 data members: .data1, .data2, .data3 and 
.data4, each can access 8 bits of information, and together can 
access all of 4 bytes of the integer first declared by .data1. As 
can be seen by the generated assembly code, the values of bf are 
follow natural order as written in the C code: 12 34 56 78, since 
each value is a separate members. In contrast, the value of i is 
a number as a whole, so it is subject to the rule of little 
endianess and thus contains the value 78 56 34 12. Note that at 
804a02f, is the address of the final byte in bf, but next to it 
is a number 12, despite 78 is the last number in it. This extra 
number 12 does not belong to the value of bf. objdump is just 
being confused that 78 is an opcode; 78 corresponds to js 
instruction, and it requires an operand. For that reason, objdump 
grabs whatever the next byte after 78 and put it there. objdump 
is a tool to display assembly code after all. A better tool to 
use is gdb that we will learn in the next chapter. But for this 
chapter, objdump suffices.

Unlike bf, each data member in ns is allocated fully as an 
integer, 4 bytes each, 16 bytes in total. As we can see, bit 
field and normal struct are different: bit field structure data 
at the bit level, while normal struct works at byte level.

Finally, the struct of bf2[footnote:
bit_field2
] is the same of bf[footnote:
bit_field
], except it contains one more data member: .data5, and is 
defined as an integer. For this reason, another 4 bytes are 
allocated just for .data5, even though it can only access 8 bits 
of information, and the final value of bf2 is: 12 34 56 78 0f 00 
00 00. The remaining 3 bytes must be accessed by the mean of a 
pointer, or casting to another data type that can fully access 
all 4 bytes..

What happens when the definition of bit_field struct and bf 
variable are changed to:

  struct bit_field {

      int data1:8;

  };

  struct bit_field bf = {

      .data1 = 0x1234,

  };

  What will be the value of .data1?

  What happens when the definition of bit_field2 struct is 
  changed to:

  struct bit_field2 {

      int data1:8;

      int data5:32;

  };

  What is layout of a variable of type bit_field2?

  String Data Types

Although share the same name, string as defined by x86 is 
different than a string in C. x86 defines string as “continuous 
sequences of bits, bytes, words, or doublewords”. On the other 
hand, C defines a string as an array of 1-byte characters with a 
zero as the last element of the array to make a null-terminated 
string. This implies that strings in x86 are arrays, not C 
strings. A programmer can define an array of bytes, words or 
doublewords with char or uint8_t, short or uint16_t and int or 
uint32_t, except an array of bits. However, such a feature can be 
easily implemented, as an array of bits is essentially any array 
of bytes, or words or doublewords, but operates at the bit level.

The following code demonstrates how to define array (string) data 
types:

  Source

  #include <stdint.h>

uint16_t @|\color{blue}\bfseries a16[2]|@ = {0x1234, 0x5678};

uint32_t @|\color{magenta}\bfseries a32[2]|@ = {0x12345678, 
0x9abcdef0};

uint64_t @|\color{green}\bfseries a64[2]|@ = {0x123456789abcdef0, 
0x123456789abcdef0};

    return 0;

}

  [eax+eax*1]

   804a01b: 00 34 12                add    BYTE PTR 
  [edx+edx*1],dh

   804a020: 78 56                   js     804a078 <_end+0x3c>

   804a022: 34 12                   xor    al,0x12

   804a024: f0 de bc 9a f0 de bc    lock fidivr WORD PTR 
  [edx+ebx*4-0x65432110]

   804a030: f0 de bc 9a 78 56 34    lock fidivr WORD PTR 
  [edx+ebx*4+0x12345678]

   804a037: 12 

Despite a8 is an array with 2 elements, each is 1-byte long, but 
it is still allocated with 4 bytes. Again, to ensure natural 
alignment for best performance, gcc pads extra zero bytes. As 
shown in the assembly listing, the actual value of a8 is 12 34 00 
00, with a8[0] equals to 12 and a8[1] equals to 34.

Then it comes a16 with 2 elements, each is 2-byte long. Since 2 
elements are 4 bytes in total, which is in the natural alignment, 
gcc pads no byte. The value of a16 is 34 12 78 56, with a16[0] 
equals to 34 12 and a16[1] equals to 78 56. Note that, objdump is 
confused again, as de is the opcode for the instruction fidivr 
(short of reverse divide) that requires another operand, so 
objdump grabs whatever the next bytes that makes sense to it for 
creating “an operand”. Only the highlighted values belong to a32. 

Next is a32, with 2 elements, 4 bytes each. Similar to above 
arrays, the value of a32[0] is 78 56 34 12, the value of a32[1] 
is f0 de bc 9a, exactly what is assigned in the C code.

Finally is a64, also with 2 elements, but 8 bytes each. The total 
size of a64 is 16 bytes, which is in the natural alignment, 
therefore no padding bytes added. The values of both a64[0] and 
a64[1] are the same: f0 de bc 9a 78 56 34 12, that got 
misinterpreted to fidivr instruction.

Technically, multi-dimensional arrays are like normal arrays: in 
the end, the total size is translated into flat allocated bytes. 
A 2 x 2 array is allocated with 4 bytes; a 2\times2\times2
 array 
is allocated with 8 bytes, as can be seen in the assembly listing 
of a2[footnote:
Again, objdump is confused and put the number 12 next to 78 in a3 
listing.
] and a3. In low-level assembly code, the representation is the 
same between a[4] and a[2][2]. However, in high-level C code, the 
difference is tremendous. The syntax of multi-dimensional array 
enables a programmer to think with higher level concepts, instead 
of translating manually from high-level concepts to low-level 
code and work with high-level concepts in his head at the same 
time. 

The following two-dimensional array can hold a list of 2 names 
with the length of 10:

  char names[2][10] = {

    "John Doe",

    "Jane Doe"

};

  To access a name, we simply adjust the column index[footnote:
The left index is called column index since it changes the index 
based on a column.
] e.g. names[0], names[1]. To access individual character within 
  a name, we use the row index[footnote:
Same with column index, the right index is called row index since 
it changes the index based on a row.
] e.g. names[0][0] gives the character “J”, names[0][1] gives the 
  character “o” and so on.

  Without such syntax, we need to create a 20-byte array e.g. 
  names[20], and whenever we want to access a character e.g. to 
  check if the names contains with a number in it, we need to 
  calculate the index manually. It would be distracting, since we 
  constantly need to switch thinkings between the actual problem 
  and the translate problem. 

  Since this is a repeating pattern, C abstracts away this 
  problem with the syntax for define and manipulating 
  multi-dimensional array. Through this example, we can clearly 
  see the power of abstraction through language can give us. It 
  would be ideal if a programmer is equipped with such power to 
  define whatever syntax suitable for a problem at hands. Not 
  many languages provide such capacity. Fortunately, through C 
  macro, we can partially achieve that goal .

In all cases, an array is guaranteed to generate contiguous bytes 
of memory, regardless of the dimensions it has.

What is the difference between a multi-dimensional array and an 
array of pointers, or even pointers of pointers?

  Examine compiled code

This section will explore how compiler transform high level code 
into assembly code that CPU can execute, and see how common 
assembly patterns help to create higher level syntax. -S option 
is added to objdump to better demonstrate the connection between 
high and low level code.

In this section, the option --no-show-raw-insn is added to 
objdump command to omit the opcodes for clarity:



$ objdump --no-show-raw-insn -M intel -S -D <object file> | less 



  Data Transfer

Previous section explores how various types of data are created, 
and how they are laid out in memory. Once memory storages are 
allocated for variables, they must be accessible and writable. 
Data transfer instructions move data (bytes, words, doublewords 
or quadwords) between memory and registers, and between 
registers, effectively read from a storage source and write to 
another storage source.

The general data movement is performed with the mov instruction. 
Note that despite the instruction being called mov, it actually 
copies data from one destination to another.

The red instruction copies data from the register esp to the 
register ebp. This mov instruction moves data between registers 
and is assigned the opcode 89.

The blue instructions copies data from one memory location (the i 
variable) to another (the j variable). There exists no data 
movement from memory to memory; it requires two mov instructions, 
one for copying the data from a memory location to a register, 
and one for copying the data from the register to the destination 
memory location.

The pink instruction copies an immediate value into memory. 
Finally, the green instruction copies immediate data into a 
register.

  Assembly

  The full assembly listing is really long. For that reason, we 
  examine expression by expression.

  Expression: int add = i + j;

     80483e1:       mov    edx,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

     80483e4:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]

     80483e7:       add    eax,edx

     80483e9:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x34],eax

    The assembly code is straight forward: variable i and j are 
    stored in eax and edx respectively, then added together with 
    the add instruction, and the final result is stored into eax. 
    Then, the result is saved into the local variable add, which 
    is at the location [ebp-0x34].

  Expression: int sub = i - j;

    80483ec:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

    80483ef:       sub    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]

    80483f2:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x30],eax

    Similar to add instruction, x86 provides a sub instruction 
    for subtraction. Hence, gcc translates a subtraction into sub 
    instruction, with eax is reloaded with i, as eax still 
    carries the result from previous expression. Then, j is 
    subtracted from i. After the subtraction, the value is saved 
    into the variable sub, at location [ebp-0x30].

  Expression: int mul = i * j;

    80483f5:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

    80483f8:       imul   eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]

    80483fc:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x34],eax

    Similar to sub instruction, only eax is reloaded, since it 
    carries the result of previous calculation. imul performs 
    signed multiply[footnote:
Unsigned multiply is perform by mul instruction.
]. eax is first loaded with i, then is multiplied with j and 
    stored the result back into eax, then stored into the 
    variable mul at location [ebp-0x34].

  Expression: int div = i / j;

    80483ff:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

    8048402:       cdq    

    8048403:       idiv   DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]

    8048406:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x30],eax

    Similar to imul, idiv performs sign divide. But, different 
    from imul above idiv only takes one operand:

    1. First, i is reloaded into eax. 

    2. Then, cdq converts the double word value in eax into a 
      quadword value stored in the pair of registers edx:eax, by 
      copying the signed (bit 31[superscript:th]) of the value in eax into every bit position in edx. The pair 
      edx:eax is the dividend, which is the variable i, and the 
      operand to idiv is the divisor, which is the variable j. 

    3. After the calculation, the result is stored into the pair 
      edx:eax registers, with the quotient in eax and remainder 
      in edx. The quotient is stored in the variable div, at 
      location [ebp-0x30].

  Expression: int mod = i % j;

    8048409:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

    804840c:       cdq    

    804840d:       idiv   DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]

    8048410:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x2c],edx

    The same idiv instruction also performs the modulo operation, 
    since it also calculates a remainder and stores in the 
    variable mod, at location [ebp-0x2c].

  Expression: int neg = -i;

    8048413:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8] 

    8048416:       neg    eax                     

    8048418:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x28],eax

    neg replaces the value of operand (the destination operand) 
    with its two's complement (this operation is equivalent to 
    subtracting the operand from 0). In this example, the value i 
    in eax is replaced replaced with -i using neg instruction. 
    Then, the new value is stored in the variable neg at 
    [ebp-0x28].

  Expression: int and = i & j;

    804841b:        mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8] 

    804841e:        and    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc] 

    8048421:        mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x24],eax

    and performs a bitwise AND operation on two operands, and 
    stores the result in the destination operand, which is the 
    variable and at [ebp-0x24].

  Expression: int or = i | j;

    8048424:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8] 

    8048427:       or     eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc] 

    804842a:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x20],eax

    Similar to and instruction, or performs a bitwise OR 
    operation on two operands, and stores the result in the 
    destination operand, which is the variable or at [ebp-0x20] 
    in this case.

  Expression: int xor = i ^ j;

    804842d:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8] 

    8048430:       xor    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc] 

    8048433:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x1c],eax

    Similar to and/or instruction, xor performs a bitwise XOR 
    operation on two operands, and stores the result in the 
    destination operand, which is the variable xor at [ebp-0x1c].

  Expression: int not = ~i;

    8048436:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8] 

    8048439:       not    eax                     

    804843b:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x18],eax

    not performs a bitwise NOT operation (each 1 is set to 0, and 
    each 0 is set to 1) on the destination operand and stores the 
    result in the destination operand location, which is the 
    variable not at [ebp-0x18]. 

  Expression: int shl = i << 8;

    804843e:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

    8048441:	   shl    eax,0x8

    8048444:	   mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x14],eax

    shl (shift logical left) shifts the bits in the destination 
    operand to the left by the number of bits specified in the 
    source operand. In this case, eax stores i and shl shifts eax 
    by 8 bits to the left. A different name for shl is sal (shift 
    arithmetic left). Both can be used synonymous. Finally, the 
    result is stored in the variable shl at [ebp-0x14].

    Here is a visual demonstration of shl/sal and shr 
    instructions:

    

    After shifting to the left, the right most bit is set for 
    Carry Flag in EFLAGS register.

  Expression: int shr = i >> 8;

    8048447:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

    804844a:   	sar    eax,0x8

    804844d:   	mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x10],eax

    sar is similar to shl/sal, but shift bits to the right and 
    extends the sign bit. For right shift, shr and sar are two 
    different instructions. shr differs to sar is that it does 
    not extend the sign bit. Finally, the result is stored in the 
    variable shr at [ebp-0x10].

    In the figure (b), notice that initially, the sign bit is 1, 
    but after 1-bit and 10-bit shiftings, the shifted-out bits 
    are filled with zeros.

    [float Figure:
[Figure 0.14:
SAR Instruction Operation (Source: Figure 7-8, Volume 1)
]

     <Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/04/sar.pdf>
     
]

    With sar, the sign bit (the most significant bit) is 
    preserved. That is, if the sign bit is 0, the new bits always 
    get the value 0; if the sign bit is 1, the new bits always 
    get the value 1.

  Expression: char equal1 = (i == j);

    8048450:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

    8048453:       cmp    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]

    8048456:       sete   al                     

    8048459:       mov    BYTE PTR [ebp-0x41],al

    cmp and variants of the variants of set instructions make up 
    all the logical comparisons. In this expression, cmp compares 
    variable i and j; then sete stores the value 1 to al register 
    if the comparison from cmp earlier is equal, or stores 0 
    otherwise. The general name for variants of set instruction 
    is called SETcc. The suffix cc denotes the condition being 
    tested for in EFLAGS register. Appendix B in volume 1, 
    “EFLAGS Condition Codes”, lists the conditions it is possible 
    to test for with this instruction. Finally, the result is 
    stored in the variable equal1 at [ebp-0x41].

  Expression: int equal2 = (i == j);

    804845c:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

    804845f:       cmp    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]

    8048462:       sete   al

    8048465:       movzx  eax,al

    8048468:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc],eax

    Similar to equality comparison, this expression also compares 
    for equality, with an exception that the result is stored in 
    an int type. For that reason, one more instruction is a 
    added: movzx instruction, a variant of mov that copies the 
    result into a destination operand and fills the remaining 
    bytes with 0. In this case, since eax is 4-byte wide, after 
    copying the first byte in al, the remaining bytes of eax are 
    filled with 0 to ensure the eax carries the same value as al.

    Logical AND operator && is one of the syntaxes that is made 
    entirely in software[footnote:
That is, there is no equivalent assembly instruction implemented 
in hardware.
] with simpler instructions. The algorithm from the assembly code 
    is simple:

    1. First, check if i is 0 with the instruction at 0x804849b. 

      (a) If true, jump to 0x80484ae and set eax to 0. 

      (b) Set the variable logical_and to 0, as it is the next 
        instruction after 0x80484ae.

    2. If i is not 0, check if j is 0 with the instruction at 
      0x80484a1. 

      (a) If true, jump to 0x80484ae and set eax to 0.

      (b) Set the variable logical_and to 0, as it is the next 
        instruction after 0x80484ae.

    3. If both i and j are not 0, the result is certainly 1, or 
      true.

      (a) Set it accordingly with the instruction at 0x80484a7. 

      (b) Then jump to the instruction at 0x80484b3 to set the 
        variable logical_and at [ebp-0x8] to 1.

  Expression: int logical_or = (i || j);

    80484b6:       cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8],0x0

    80484ba:       jne    80484c2 <expr+0xe7>    

    80484bc:       cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc],0x0

    80484c0:       je     80484c9 <expr+0xee>    

    80484c2:       mov    eax,0x1                

    80484c7:       jmp    80484ce <expr+0xf3>    

    80484c9:       mov    eax,0x0                

    80484ce:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4],eax

    Logical OR operator || is similar to logical and above. 
    Understand the algorithm is left as an exercise for readers.

  Expression: ++i; and --i; (or i++ and i--)

    80484d1:       add    DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8],0x1

    80484d5:       sub    DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8],0x1

    The syntax of increment and decrement is similar to logical 
    AND and logical OR in that it is made from existing 
    instruction, that is add. The difference is that the CPU 
    actually does has a built-in instruction, but gcc decided not 
    to use the instruction because inc and dec cause a partial 
    flag register stall, occurs when an instruction modifies a 
    part of the flag register and the following instruction is 
    dependent on the outcome of the flags (section 3.5.2.6, Intel Optimization Manual, 2016
    ). The manual even suggests that inc and dec should be 
    replaced with add and sub instructions (section 3.5.1.1, Intel Optimization Manual, 2016
    ). 

  Expression: int i1 = i++;

    80484d9:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

    80484dc:       lea    edx,[eax+0x1]

    80484df:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8],edx

    80484e2:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x10],eax

    First, i is copied into eax at 80484d9. Then, the value of 
    eax + 0x1 is copied into edx as an effective address at 
    80484dc. The lea (load effective address) instruction copies 
    a memory address into a register. According to Volume 2, the 
    source operand is a memory address specified with one of the 
    processors addressing modes. This means, the source operand 
    must be specified by the addressing modes defined in 
    16-bit/32-bit ModR/M Byte tables, [mod-rm-16] and [mod-rm-32]
    .

    After loading the incremented value into edx, the value of i 
    is increased by 1 at 80484df. Finally, the previous i value 
    is stored back to i1 at [ebp-0x8] by the instruction at 
    80484e2.

  Expression: int i2 = ++i;

    80484e5:       add    DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8],0x1

    80484e9:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

    80484ec:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc],eax

    The primary differences between this increment syntax and the 
    previous one are:

    • add is used instead of lea to increase i directly.

    • the newly incremented i is stored into i2 instead of the 
      old value.

    • the expression only costs 3 instructions instead of 4.

    This prefix-increment syntax is faster than the post-fix one 
    used previously. It might not matter much which version to 
    use if the increment is only used once or a few hundred times 
    in a small loop, but it matters when a loop runs millions or 
    more times. Also, depends on different circumstances, it is 
    more convenient to use one over the other e.g. if i is an 
    index for accessing an array, we want to use the old value 
    for accessing previous array element and newly incremented i 
    for current element.

  Stack

A stack is a contiguous array of memory locations that holds a 
collection of discrete data. When a new element is added, a stack 
grows down in memory toward lesser addresses, and shrinks up 
toward greater addresses when an element is removed. x86 uses the 
esp register to point to the top of the stack, at the newest 
element. A stack can be originated anywhere in main memory, as 
esp can be set to any memory address. x86 provides two operations 
for manipulating stacks: 

• push instruction and its variants add a new element on top of 
  the stack

• pop instructions and its variants remove the top-most element 
  from the stack.

  Automatic variables

Local variables are variables that exist within a scope. A scope 
is delimited by a pair of braces: {..}. The most common scope to 
define local variables is at function scope. However, scope can 
be unnamed, and variables created inside an unnamed scope do not 
exist outside of its scope and its inner scope. 

Function scope:

  void foo() {

    int a;

    int b;

}

  a and b are variables local to the function foo.



Unnamed scope:

  int foo() {

    int i;



    {

        int a = 1;

        int b = 2;

        {

            return i = a + b;

        }

    }

}

  a and b are local to where it is defined and local into its 
  inner child scope that return i = a + b. However, they do not 
  exist at the function scope that creates i.

When a local variable is created, it is pushed on the stack; when 
a local variable goes out of scope, it is pop out of the stack, 
thus destroyed. When an argument is passed from a caller to a 
callee, it is pushed on the stack; when a callee returns to the 
caller, the arguments are popped out the stack. The local 
variables and arguments are automatically allocated upon enter a 
function and destroyed after exiting a function, that's why it's 
called automatic variables.

A base frame pointer points to the start of the current function 
frame, and is kept in ebp register. Whenever a function is 
called, it is allocated with its own dedicated storage on stack, 
called stack frame. A stack frame is where all local variables 
and arguments of a function are placed on a stack[footnote:
Data and only data are exclusively allocated on stack for every 
stack frame. No code resides here.
]. 

When a function needs a local variable or an argument, it uses 
ebp to access a variable:

• All local variables are allocated after the ebp pointer. Thus, 
  to access a local variable, a number is subtracted from ebp to 
  reach the location of the variable. 

• All arguments are allocated before ebp pointer. To access an 
  argument, a number is added to ebp to reach the location of the 
  argument. 

• The ebp itself pointer points to the return address of its 
  caller.

    return i;

}

  Assembly

  080483db <add>:

  #include <stdint.h>

  int add(int a, int b) {

   80483db:       push   ebp

   80483dc:       mov    ebp,esp

   80483de:       sub    esp,0x10

      int i = a + b;

   80483e1:       mov    edx,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

   80483e4:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]

   80483e7:       add    eax,edx

   80483e9:       mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4],eax

      return i;

   80483ec:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4]

  }

   80483ef:       leave  

   80483f0:       ret    

In the assembly listing, [ebp-0x4] is the local variable i, since 
it is allocated after ebp, with the length of 4 bytes (an int). 
On the other hand, a and b are arguments and can be accessed with 
ebp: 

• [ebp+0x8] accesses a.

• [ebp+0xc] access b.

For accessing arguments, the rule is that the closer a variable 
on stack to ebp, the closer it is to a function name.

  #include <stdio.h>

    int local = 0x12345;



    return a + b;

  Assembly

  For every function call, gcc pushes arguments on the stack in 
  reversed order with the push instructions. That is, the 
  arguments pushed on stack are in reserved order as it is 
  written in high level C code, to ensure the relative order 
  between arguments, as seen in previous section how function 
  arguments and local variables are laid out. Then, gcc generates 
  a call instruction, which then implicitly pushes a return 
  address before transferring the control to add function:

  080483f2 <main>:

  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

   80483f2:       push   ebp

   80483f3:       mov    ebp,esp

      add(1,2);

   80483f5:       push   0x2

   80483f7:       push   0x1

   80483f9:       call   80483db <add>

   80483fe:       add    esp,0x8

      return 0;

   8048401:       mov    eax,0x0

  }

   8048406:       leave  

   8048407:       ret    

Upon finishing the call to add function, the stack is restored by 
adding 0x8 to stack pointer esp (which is equivalent to 2 pop 
instructions). Finally, a leave instruction is executed and main 
returns with a ret instruction. A ret instruction transfers the 
program execution back to the caller to the instruction right 
after the call instruction, the add instruction. The reason ret 
can return to such location is that the return address implicitly 
pushed by the call instruction, which is the address right after 
the call instruction; whenever the CPU executes ret instruction, 
it retrieves the return address that sits right after all the 
arguments on the stack:

At the end of a function, gcc places a leave instruction to clean 
up all spaces allocated for local variables and restore the frame 
pointer to frame pointer of the caller.

080483db <add>:

#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {

 80483db:       push   ebp

 80483dc:       mov    ebp,esp

 80483de:       sub    esp,0x10

    int local = 0x12345;

 80483e1:       DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4],0x12345

    return a + b;

 80483e8:       mov    edx,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]

 80483eb:       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]

 80483ee:       add    eax,edx

}

 80483f0:       leave  

 80483f1:       ret

  Loop

Loop is simply resetting the instruction pointer to an already 
executed instruction and starting from there all over again. A 
loop is just one application of jmp instruction. However, because 
looping is a pervasive pattern, it earned its own syntax in C.

   80483ff: 90                    nop

  The colors mark corresponding high level code to assembly code:

  1. The red instruction initialize i to 0.

  2. The green instructions compare i to 10 by using jle and 
    compare it to 9. If true, jump to 80483ea for another 
    iteration.

  3. The blue instruction increase i by 1, making the loop able 
    to terminate once the terminate condition is satisfied.

  Why does the increment instruction (the blue instruction) 
  appears before the compare instructions (the green 
  instructions)?

    What assembly code can be generated for while and do...while?

  Conditional

Again, conditional in C with if...else... construct is just 
another application of jmp instruction under the hood. It is also 
a pervasive pattern that earned its own syntax in C.

   80483f5:        jmp    80483fe <main+0x23>

      } else {

          i = 0;

   80483f7:        mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4],0x0

      }

      return 0;

   80483fe:        mov    eax,0x0

  }

   8048403:        leave  

   8048404:        ret    

  The generated assembly code follows the same order as the 
  corresponding high level syntax:

  • red instructions represents if branch.

  • blue instructions represents else branch.

  • green instruction is the exit point for both if and else 
    branch.

  if branch first compares whether argc is false (equal to 0) 
  with cmp instruction. If true, it proceeds to else branch at 
  80483f7. Otherwise, if branch continues with the code of its 
  branch, which is the next instruction at 80483ee for copying 1 
  to i. Finally, it skips over else branch and proceeds to 
  80483fe, which is the next instruction pasts the if..else... 
  construct.

  else branch is entered when cmp instruction from if branch is 
  true. else branch starts at 80483f7, which is the first 
  instruction of else branch. The instruction copies 0 to i, and 
  proceeds naturally to the next instruction pasts the 
  if...else... construct without any jump.

The Anatomy of a Program<chap:The-Anatomy-of-a-program>

Every program consists of code and data, and only those two 
components made up a program. However, if a program consists 
purely code and data of its own, from the perspective of an 
operating system (as well as human), it does not know in a 
program, which block of binary is a program and which is just raw 
data, where in the program to start execution, which region of 
memory should be protected and which is free to modify. For that 
reason, each program carries extra metadata to communicate with 
the operating system how to handle the program.

When a source file is compiled, the generated machine code is 
stored into an object file[margin:
object file
]object file, which is just a block of binary. One or more object 
files can be combined to produce an executable binary[margin:
executable binary
]executable binary, which is a complete program runnable in an 
operating system.

readelf is a program that recognizes and displays the ELF 
metadata of a binary file, be it an object file or an executable 
binary. ELF, or Executable and Linkable Format, is the content at 
the very beginning of an executable to provide an operating 
system necessary information to load into main memory and run the 
executable. ELF can be thought of similar to the table of 
contents of a book. In a book, a table of contents list the page 
numbers of the main sections, subsections, sometimes even figures 
and tables for easy lookup. Similarly, ELF lists various sections 
used for code and data, and the memory addresses of each symbol 
along with other information.

An ELF binary is composed of:

• An ELF header[margin:
ELF header
]ELF header: the very first section of an executable that 
  describes the file's organization.

• A Program header table[margin:
program header table
]program header table: is an array of fixed-size structures that 
  describes segments of an executable.

• A Section header table[margin:
section header table
]section header table: is an array of fixed-size structures that 
  describes sections of an executable. 

• Segments and section[margin:
Segments and sections
]Segments and sections are the main content of an ELF binary, 
  which are the code and data, divided into chunks of different 
  purposes.

  A segmentsegment is a composition of zero or more sections and 
  is directly loaded by an operating system at runtime.

  A sectionsection is a block of binary that is either:

  – actual program code and data that is available in memory when 
    a program runs. 

  – metadata about other sections used only in the linking 
    process, and disappear from the final executable.

  Linker uses sections to build segments.

]

Later we will compile our kernel as an ELF executable with GCC, 
and explicitly specify how segments are created and where they 
are loaded in memory through the use a linker script, a text file 
to instruct how a linker should generate a binary. For now, we 
will examine the anatomy of an ELF executable in detail.

  Reference documents: 

The [margin:
ELF specification
]ELF specification is bundled as a man page in Linux:



$ man elf



It is a useful resource to understand and implement ELF. However, 
it will be much easier to use after you finish this chapter, as 
the specification mixes implementation details in it.

The default specification is a generic one, in which every ELF 
implementation follows. However, each platform provides extra 
features unique to it. The ELF specification for x86 is currently 
maintained on Github by H.J. Lu: https://github.com/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/wiki/X86-psABI
. 

Platform-dependent details are referred to as “processor specific”
 in the generic ELF specification. We will not explore these 
details, but study the generic details, which are enough for 
crafting an ELF binary image for our operating system.

  Magic

  Displays the raw bytes that uniquely addresses a file is an ELF 
  executable binary. Each byte gives a brief information.

  In the example, we have the following magic bytes:

  

  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00    Padding bytes. These bytes are unused and are always set to 0. 
Padding bytes are added for proper alignment, and is reserved for 
future use when more information is needed.

  ----------------------------
      0      Invalid version  
      1      Current version  
  

  OS/ABI

  A byte in Magic field. It specifies the target operating system 
  ABI. Originally, it was a padding byte.

  Possible values: Refer to the latest ABI document, as it is a 
  long list of different operating systems.

  Type

  Identifies the object file type.

   
  Value     Description                      
            -----------------------------------
  ---------------------------------------------
      0       No file type                     
      1       Relocatable file                 
      2       Executable file                  
      3       Shared object file               
      4       Core file                        
    0xff00    Processor specific, lower bound  
    0xffff    Processor specific, upper bound  
  

  The values from 0xff00 to 0xffff are reserved for a processor 
  to define additional file types meaningful to it.

  Machine

  Specifies the required architecture value for an ELF file e.g. 
  x86_64, MIPS, SPARC, etc. In the example, the machine is of x86_64
   architecture.

  Possible values: Please refer to the latest ABI document, as it 
  is a long list of different architectures.

  Version

  Specifies the version number of the current object file (not 
  the version of the ELF header, as the above Version field 
  specified).

  Entry point address

  Specifies the memory address where the very first code to be 
  executed. The address of main function is the default in a 
  normal application program, but it can be any function by 
  explicitly specifying the function name to gcc. For the 
  operating system we are going to write, this is the single most 
  important field that we need to retrieve to bootstrap our 
  kernel, and everything else can be ignored.

  Start of program headers

  The offset of the program header table, in bytes. In the 
  example, this number is 64 bytes, which means the 65th byte, or 
  <start address> + 64, is the start address of the program 
  header table. That is, if a program is loaded at address 0x10000
   in memory, then the start address is 0x10000 (the very first 
  byte of Magic field, where the value 0x7f resides) and the 
  start address of program header table is 0x10000 + 0x40 = 0x10040
  .

  Start of section headers

  The offset of the section header table in bytes, similar to the 
  start of program headers. In the example, it is 6648 bytes into 
  file.

  Flags

  Hold processor-specific flags associated with the file. When 
  the program is loaded, in a x86 machine, EFLAGS register is set 
  according to this value. In the example, the value is 0x0, 
  which means EFLAGS register is in a clear state.

  Size of this header

  Specifies the total size of ELF header's size in bytes. In the 
  example, it is 64 bytes, which is equivalent to Start of 
  program headers. Note that these two numbers are not necessary 
  equivalent, as program header table might be placed far away 
  from the ELF header. The only fixed component in the ELF 
  executable binary is the ELF header, which appears at the very 
  beginning of the file.

  Size of program headers

  Specifies the size of each program header in bytes. In the 
  example, it is 64 bytes.

  Number of program headers

  Specifies the total number of program headers. In the example, 
  the file has a total of 9 program headers.

  Size of section headers

  Specifies the size of each section header in bytes. In the 
  example, it is 64 bytes.

  Number of section headers

  Specifies the total number of section headers. In the example, 
  the file has a total of 31 section headers. In a section header 
  table, the first entry in the table is always an empty section.

  Section header string table index

  Specifies the index of the header in the section header table 
  that points to the section that holds all null-terminated 
  strings. In the example, the index is 28, which means it's the 
  28[superscript:th] entry of the table. 

  Section header table

As we know already, code and data compose a program. However, not 
all types of code and data have the same purpose. For that 
reason, instead of a big chunk of code and data, they are divided 
into smaller chunks, and each chunk must satisfy these conditions 
(according to gABI):

• Every section in an object file has exactly one section header 
  describing it. But, section headers may exist that do not have 
  a section.

• Each section occupies one contiguous (possibly empty) sequence 
  of bytes within a file. That means, there's no two regions of 
  bytes that are the same section.

• Sections in a file may not overlap. No byte in a file resides 
  in more than one section.

• An object file may have inactive space. The various headers and 
  the sections might not “cover” every byte in an object file. 
  The contents of the inactive data are unspecified.

To get all the headers from an executable binary e.g. hello, use 
the following command:



$ readelf -S hello



Here is a sample output (do not worry if you don't understand the 
output. Just skim to get your eyes familiar with it. We will 
dissect it soon enough):



There are 31 section headers, starting at offset 0x19c8:

The first line:



There are 31 section headers, starting at offset 0x19c8



summarizes the total number of sections in the file, and where 
the address where it starts. Then, comes the listing section by 
section with the following header, is also the format of each 
section output:



[Nr] Name              Type             Address           Offset

     Size              EntSize          Flags  Link  Info  Align



Each section has two lines with different fields:

  Nr The index of each section.

  Name The name of each section.

  Type This field (in a section header) identifies the type of 
  each section. Types classify sections (similar to types in 
  programming languages are used by a compiler). 

  Address The starting virtual address of each section. Note that 
  the addresses are virtual only when a program runs in an OS 
  with support for virtual memory enabled. In our OS, since we 
  run on bare metal, the addresses will all be physical.

  Offset The offset of each section into a file. An [margin:
offset
]offsetoffset is a distance in bytes, from the first byte of a 
  file to the start of an object, such as a section or a segment 
  in the context of an ELF binary file.

  Size The size in bytes of each section.

  EntSize Some sections hold a table of fixed-size entries, such 
  as a symbol table. For such a section, this member gives the 
  size in bytes of each entry. The member contains 0 if the 
  section does not hold a table of fixed-size entries.

  Flags describes attributes of a section. Flags together with a 
  type defines the purpose of a section. Two sections can be of 
  the same type, but serve different purposes. For example, even 
  though .data and .text share the same type, .data holds the 
  initialized data of a program while .text holds executable 
  instructions of a program. For that reason, .data is given read 
  and write permission, but not executable. Any attempt to 
  execute code in .data is denied by the running OS: in Linux, 
  such invalid section usage gives a segmentation fault.

  ELF gives information to enable an OS with such protection 
  mechanism. However, running on bare metal, nothing can prevent 
  from doing anything. Our OS can execute code in data section, 
  and vice versa, writing to code section.

doesn't know of.                                                                                                                   |

  Link and Info are numbers that references the indexes of 
  sections, symbol table entries, hash table entries. Link field 
  holds the index of a section, while Info field holds an index 
  of a section, a symbol table entry or a hash table entry, 
  depends on the type of a section. 

  Later when writing our OS, we will handcraft the kernel image 
  by explicitly linking the object files (produced by gcc) 
  through a linker script. We will specify the memory layout of 
  sections by specifying at what addresses they will appear in 
  the final image. But we will not assign any section flag and 
  let the linker take care of it. Nevertheless, knowing which 
  flag does what is useful.

  Align is a value that enforces the offset of a section should 
  be divisible by the value. Only 0 and positive integral powers 
  of two are allowed. Values 0 and 1 mean the section has no 
  alignment constraint.

  Understand Section in-depth

In this section, we will learn different details of section types 
and the purposes of special sections e.g. .bss, .text, .data... 
by looking at each section one by one. We will also examine the 
content of each section as a hexdump with the commands:



$ readelf -x <section name|section number> <file>



For example, if you want to examine the content of section with 
index 25 (the .bss section in the sample output) in the file 
hello:



$ readelf -x 25 hello



Equivalently, using name instead of index works:



$ readelf -x .data hello



If a section contains strings e.g. string symbol table, the flag 
-x can be replaced with -p.

  NULL marks a section header as inactive and does not have an 
  associated section. NULL section is always the first entry of 
  section header table. It means, any useful section starts from 
  1.

  The sample output of NULL section:

    

    [Nr] Name             Type             Address           
    Offset

         Size             EntSize          Flags  Link  Info  
    Align

    [ 0]                  NULL             0000000000000000

         0000000000000000 0000000000000000           0     0     
    0

    

  Examining the content, the section is empty:

  

   Section '' has no data to dump.

  

  NOTE marks a section with special information that other 
  programs will check for conformance, compatibility... by a 
  vendor or a system builder.

  In the sample output, we have 2 NOTE sections:

    

    [Nr] Name              Type             Address           
    Offset

  Examine 2nd section with the command:

  PROGBITS indicates a section holding the main content of a 
  program, either code or data.

  There are many PROGBITS sections:

  For our operating system, we only need the following section:

  .text

    This section holds all the compiled code of a program. 

  .data

    This section holds the initialized data of a program. Since 
    the data are initialized with actual values, gcc allocates 
    the section with actual byte in the executable binary.

  .rodata

    This section holds read-only data, such as fixed-size strings 
    in a program, e.g. “Hello World”, and others.

  .bss

    This section, shorts for Block Started by Symbol, holds 
    uninitialized data of a program. Unlike other sections, no 
    space is allocated for this section in the image of the 
    executable binary on disk. The section is allocated only when 
    the program is loaded into main memory.

  Other sections are mainly needed for dynamic linking, that is 
  code linking at runtime for sharing between many programs. To 
  enable such feature, an OS as a runtime environment must be 
  presented. Since we run our OS on bare metal, we are 
  effectively creating such environment. For simplicity, we won't 
  add dynamic linking to our OS.

  SYMTAB and DYNSYM These sections hold symbol table. A symbol 
  table is an array of entries that describe symbols in a 
  program. A symbol is a name assigned to an entity in a program. 
  The types of these entities are also the types of symbols, and 
  these are the possible types of an entity:

  In the sample output, section 5 and 29 are symbol tables:

    

    [Nr] Name              Type             Address

    $ readelf -s hello

    

    Output consists of 2 symbol tables, corresponding to the two 
    sections above, .dynsym and .symtab:

  TLS	The symbol is associated with a Thread-Local Storage 
    entity.

  Num is the index of an entry in a table.

  Value is the virtual memory address where the symbol is 
    located.

  Size is the size of the entity associated with a symbol.

  Type is a symbol type according to table.

    NOTYPE The type of a symbol is not specified. 

    OBJECT	The symbol is associated with a data object. In C, any 
      variable definition is of OBJECT type.

    FUNC The symbol is associated with a function or other 
      executable code. 

    SECTION	The symbol is associated with a section, and exists 
      primarily for relocation.

    FILE The symbol is the name of a source file associated with 
      an executable binary.

    COMMON	The symbol labels an uninitialized variable. That is, 
      when a variable in C is defined as global variable without 
      an initial value, or as an external variable using the 
      extern keyword. In other words, these variables stay in 
      .bss section.

  Bind is the scope of a symbol. 

    LOCAL are symbols that are only visible in the object files 
      that defined them. In C, the static modifier marks a symbol 
      (e.g. a variable/function) as local to only the file that 
      defines it.

      If we define variables and functions with static modifer:

        static int global_static_var = 0;



static void local_func() {

}



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    static int local_static_var = 0;



    return 0;

}

      Then we get the static variables listed as local symbols 
      after compiling:

        

        $ gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello

    GLOBAL	are symbols that are accessible by other object files 
      when linking together. These symbols are primarily 
      non-static functions and non-static global data. The extern 
      modifier marks a symbol as externally defined elsewhere but 
      is accessible in the final executable binary, so an extern 
      variable is also considered GLOBAL.

      Similar to the LOCAL example above, the output lists many 
      GLOBAL symbols such as main:

        Num:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name

    WEAK are symbols whose definitions can be redefined. 
      Normally, a symbol with multiple definitions are reported 
      as an error by a compiler. However, this constraint is lax 
      when a definition is explicitly marked as weak, which means 
      the default implementation can be replaced by a different 
      definition at link time.

      Suppose we have a default implementation of the function 
      add:

        #include <stdio.h>



__attribute__((weak)) int add(int a, int b) {

    printf("warning: function is not implemented.\n");

    return 0;

}



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("add(1,2) is %d\n", add(1,2));

    return 0;

}

        __attribute__((weak)) is a [margin:
function attribute
]function attribute. A function attributefunction attribute is 
        extra information for a compiler to handle a function 
        differently from a normal function. In this example, weak 
        attribute makes the function add a weak function,which 
        means the default implementation can be replaced by a 
        different definition at link time. Function attribute is 
        a feature of a compiler, not standard C.

        If we do not supply a different function definition in a 
        different file (must be in a different file, otherwise 
        gcc reports as an error), then the default implementation 
        is applied. When the function add is called, it only 
        prints the message: "warning: function not 
        implemented"and returns 0:

        

        $ ./hello 

        warning: function is not implemented.

        add(1,2) is 0

        

        However, if we supply a different definition in another 
        file e.g. math.c:

        int add(int a, int b) {

    return a + b;

}

        and compile the two files together:

        

        $ gcc math.c hello.c -o hello

        

        Then, when running hello, no warning message is printed 
        and the correct value is returned.

        Weak symbol is a mechanism to provide a default 
        implementation, but replaceable when a better 
        implementation is available (e.g. more specialized and 
        optimized) at link-time.

  Name is the symbol name.

  A C application program always starts from symbol main. The 
  entry for main in the symbol table in .symtab section is:

    

    Num:                Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx

     62:     0000000000400526    32 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   14 
    main

    

  The entry shows that:

  • main is the 62[superscript:th] entry in the table.

  • main starts at address 0x0000000000400526.

  • main consumes 32 bytes.

  • main is a function.

  • main is in global scope.

  • main is visible to other object files that use it.

  • main is inside the 14[superscript:th] section, which is .text. This is logical, since .text holds all 
    program code.

  STRTAB hold a table of null-terminated strings, called string 
  table. The first and last byte of this section is always a NULL 
  character. A string table section exists because a string can 
  be reused by more than one section to represent symbol and 
  section names, so a program like readelf or objdump can display 
  various objects in a program, e.g. variable, functions, section 
  names, in a human-readable text instead of its raw hex address.

  In the sample output, section 28 and 30 are of STRTAB type:

  .shstrtab holds all the section names.

  .strtab holds the symbols e.g. variable names, function names, 
    struct names, etc., in a C program, but not fixed-size 
    null-terminated C strings; the C strings are kept in .rodata 
    section.

  Strings in those section can be inspected with the command:

    

    $ readelf -p 29 hello

    The actual implementation of a string table is a contiguous 
    array of null-terminated strings. The index of a string is 
    the position of its first character in the array. For 
    example, in the above string table, .symtab is at index 1 in 
    the array (NULL character is at index 0). The length of 
    .symtab is 7, plus the NULL character, which occurs 8 bytes 
    in total. So, .strtab starts at index 9, and so on.

  HASH holds a symbol hash table, which supports symbol table 
  access.

  DYNAMIC holds information for dynamic linking. 

  NOBITS is similar to PROGBITS but occupies no space.

  .bss section holds uninitialized data, which means the bytes in 
  the section can have any value. Until a operating system 
  actually loads the section into main memory, there is no need 
  to allocate space for the binary image on disk to reduce the 
  size of a binary file. Here is the details of .bss from the 
  example output:

  

  [Nr] Name              Type             Address           
  Offset

       Size              EntSize          Flags  Link  Info  
  Align

  [26] .bss              NOBITS           0000000000601038

       0000000000000008  0000000000000000  WA       0     0     1

  In the above output, the size of the section is only 8 bytes, 
  while the offsets of both sections are the same, which means 
  .bss consumes no byte of the executable binary on disk. 

  Notice that the .comment section has no starting address. This 
  means that this section is discarded when the executable binary 
  is loaded into memory.

  REL holds relocation entries without explicit addends. This 
  type will be explained in details in [sec:Understand-relocations-with-readelf]

  RELA holds relocation entries with explicit addends. This type 
  will be explained in details in [sec:Understand-relocations-with-readelf]

  INIT_ARRAY is an array of function pointers for program 
  initialization. When an application program runs, before 
  getting to main(), initialization code in .init and this 
  section are executed first. The first element in this array is 
  an ignored function pointer. 

  It might not make sense when we can include initialization code 
  in the main() function. However, for shared object files where 
  there are no main(), this section ensures that the 
  initialization code from an object file executes before any 
  other code to ensure a proper environment for main code to run 
  properly. It also makes an object file more modularity, as the 
  main application code needs not to be responsible for 
  initializing a proper environment for using a particular object 
  file, but the object file itself. Such a clear division makes 
  code cleaner.

  However, we will not use any .init and INIT_ARRAY sections in 
  our operating system, for simplicity, as initializing an 
  environment is part of the operating-system domain.

  To use the INIT_ARRAY, we simply mark a function with the 
  attribute constructor:

    #include <stdio.h>



__attribute__((constructor)) static void init1(){

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



__attribute__((constructor)) static void init2(){

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}





int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("hello world\n");



    return 0;

}

    The program automatically calls the constructor without 
    explicitly invoking it:

    

    $ gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello

    $ ./hello 

    init1

    init2

    hello world

    

  

  Optionally, a constructor can be assigned with a priority from 
  101 onward. The priorities from 0 to 100 are reserved for gcc. 
  If we want init2 to run before init1, we give it a higher 
  priority:

    #include <stdio.h>



__attribute__((constructor(102))) static void init1(){

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



__attribute__((constructor(101))) static void init2(){

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}





int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("hello world\n");



    return 0;

}

    The call order should be exactly as specified:

  

  $ gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello

  $ ./hello

  init2

  init1

  hello world

  

  

  We can add initialization functions using another method:

    #include <stdio.h>



void init1() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



void init2() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



/* Without typedef, init is a definition of a function pointer.

   With typedef, init is a declaration of a type.*/

typedef void (*init)();



__attribute__((section(".init_array"))) init init_arr[2] = 
{init1, init2};



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("hello world!\n");



    return 0;

}

    The attribute section(“...”) put a function into a particular 
    section rather then the default .text. In this example, it is 
    .init_arary. Again, the program automatically calls the 
    constructors without explicitly invoking it:

    

    $ gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello

    $ ./hello 

    init1

  init2

  hello world!

    

  FINI_ARRAY is an array of function pointers for program 
  termination, called after exiting main(). If the application 
  terminate abnormally, such as through abort() call or a crash, 
  the .finit_array is ignored.

  A destructor is automatically called after exiting main(), if 
  one or more available:

  #include <stdio.h>



__attribute__((destructor)) static void destructor(){

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("hello world\n");



    return 0;

}

  

  $ gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello

  $ ./hello 

  hello world

  destructor

  

  PREINIT_ARRAY is an array of function pointers that are invoked 
  before all other initialization functions in INIT_ARRAY.

  To use the .preinit_array, the only way to put functions into 
  this section is to use the attribute section():

  #include <stdio.h>



void preinit1() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



void preinit2() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



void init1() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



void init2() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}





typedef void (*preinit)();

typedef void (*init)();



__attribute__((section(".init_array"))) preinit preinit_arr[2] = 
{preinit1, preinit2};

__attribute__((section(".init_array"))) init init_arr[2] = 
{init1, init2};



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("hello world!\n");



    return 0;

}

  

  $ gcc -m32 hello2.c -o hello2

  $ ./hello2

  preinit1

  preinit2

  init1

  init2

  hello world!

  

  GROUP defines a section group, which is the same section that 
  appears in different object files but when merged into the 
  final executable binary file, only one copy is kept and the 
  rest in other object files are discarded. This section is only 
  relevant in C++ object files, so we will not examine further.

  SYMTAB_SHNDX is a section containing extended section indexes, 
  that are associated with a symbol table. This section only 
  appears when the Ndx value of an entry in the symbol table 
  exceeds the LORESERVE value. This section then maps between a 
  symbol and an actual index value of a section header.

Upon understanding section types, we can understand the number in 
Link and Info fields:

Verify that the value of the Link field of a SYMTAB section is 
the index of a STRTAB section.



Verify that the value of the Info field of a SYMTAB section is 
the index of last local symbol + 1. It means, in the symbol 
table, from the index listed by Info field onward, no local 
symbol appears.



Verify that the value of the Info field of a REL section is the 
index of the SYMTAB section.



Verify that the value of the Link field of a REL section is the 
index of the section where relocation is applied. For example. if 
the section is .rel.text, then the relocating section should be 
.text.

  Program header table<sec:Program-header-table>

A program header tableprogram header table is an array of program 
headers that defines the memory layout of a program at runtime. 

A program headerprogram header is a description of a program 
segment.

A program segmentprogram segment is a collection of related 
sections. A segment contains zero or more sections. An operating 
system when loading a program, only use segments, not sections. 
To see the information of a program header table, we use the -l 
option with readelf:



$ readelf -l <binary file>



Similar to a section, a program header also has types:

  PHDR specifies the location and size of the program header 
  table itself, both in the file and in the memory image of the 
  program

  INTERP specifies the location and size of a null-terminated 
  path name to invoke as an interpreter for linking runtime 
  libraries.

  LOAD specifies a loadable segment. That is, this segment is 
  loaded into main memory.

  DYNAMIC specifies dynamic linking information.

  NOTE specifies the location and size of auxiliary information.

  TLS specifies the Thread-Local Storage template, which is 
  formed from the combination of all sections with the flag TLS.

  GNU_STACK indicates whether the program's stack should be made 
  executable or not. Linux kernel uses this type.

A segment also has permission, which is a combination of these 3 
values:[float MarginTable:
[MarginTable 3:
Segment Permission
]


+-------------+-------------+
| Permission  | Description |
+-------------+-------------+
+-------------+-------------+
| R           | Readable    |

  Why? Notice the permission: 

  • the upper LOAD has Read and Execute permission. This is a 
    text segment. A text segment contains read-only instructions 
    and read-only data.

  • the lower LOAD has Read and Write permission. This is a data 
    segment. It means that this segment can be read and written 
    to, but is not allowed to be used as executable code, for 
    security reason.

  Then, LOAD contains the following sections:

  

     02     .interp .note.ABI-tag .note.gnu.build-id .gnu.hash 
  .dynsym .dynstr 

  .gnu.version .gnu.version_r .rela.dyn .rela.plt .init .plt 
  .plt.got .text .fini 

  .rodata .eh_frame_hdr .eh_frame 

     03     .init_array .fini_array .jcr .dynamic .got .got.plt 
  .data .bss 

  

  The first number is the index of a program header in program 
  header table, and the remaining text is the list of all 
  sections within a segment. Unfortunately, readelf does not 
  print the index, so a user needs to keep track manually which 
  segment is of which index. First segment starts at index 0, 
  second at index 1 and so on. LOAD are segments at index 2 and 
  3. As can be seen from the two lists of sections, most sections 
  are loadable and is available at runtime.


-------------------------------------------


  Segments vs sections

As mentioned earlier, an operating system loads program segments, 
not sections. However, a question arises: Why doesn't the 
operating system use sections instead? After all, a section also 
contains similar information to a program segment, such as the 
type, the virtual memory address to be loaded, the size, the 
attributes, the flags and align. As explained before, a segment 
is the perspective of an operating system, while a section is the 
perspective of a linker. To understand why, looking into the 
structure of a segment, we can easily see:

• A segment is a collection of sections. It means that sections 
  are logically grouped together by their attributes. For 
  example, all sections in a LOAD segment are always loaded by 
  the operating system; all sections have the same permission, 
  either a RE (Read + Execute) for executable sections, or RW 
  (Read + Write) for data sections.

• By grouping sections into a segment, it is easier for an 
  operating system to batch load sections just once by loading 
  the start and end of a segment, instead of loading section by 
  section.

• Since a segment is for loading a program and a section is for 
  linking a program, all the sections in a segment is within its 
  start and end virtual memory addresses of a segment.

To see the last point clearer, consider an example of linking two 
object files. Suppose we have two source files:

#include <stdio.h>



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("Hello World\n");

    return 0;

}

and:

int add(int a, int b) {

    return a + b;

}

Now, compile the two source files as object files:



$ gcc -m32 -c math.c 

$ gcc -m32 -c hello.c



Then, we check the sections of math.o:



$ readelf -S math.o





There are 11 section headers, starting at offset 0x1a8:

As shown in the output, all the section virtual memory addresses 
of every section are set to 0. At this stage, each object file is 
simply a block of binary that contains code and data. Its 
existence is to serve as a material container for the final 
product, which is the executable binary. As such, the virtual 
addresses in hello.o are all zeroes.

No segment exists at this stage:

Every loadable section is assigned an address, highlighted in 
green. The reason each section got its own address is that in 
reality, gcc does not combine an object by itself, but invokes 
the linker ld. The linker ld uses the default script that it can 
find in the system to build the executable binary. In the default 
script, a segment is assigned a starting address 0x8048000 and 
sections belong to it. Then:

• \mathtt{1^{st}\,section\,address=starting\,segment\,address+section\,offset=0x8048000+0x154=0x08048154}


• \mathtt{2^{nd}\,section\,address=starting\,segment\,address+section\,offset=0x8048000+0x168=0x08048168}


• .... and so on until the last loadable section...

Indeed, the end address of a segment is also the end address of 
the final section. We can see this by listing all the segments:



$ readelf -l hello



And check, for example, LOAD segment which starts at 0x08048000 
and end at \mathtt{0x08048000+0x005fc=0x080485fc}

The last section in the first LOAD segment is .eh_frame. The 
section starts at 0x08048510, with the offset 0x510 and its size 
is 0xec. The end address of .eh_frame should be: \mathtt{0x08048510+0x510+0xec=0x080485fc}

, exactly the same as the end address of the first LOAD segment.

Chapter [chap:Linking-and-loading] will explore this whole

Runtime inspection and debug

A [margin:
debugger
]debuggerdebugger is a program that allows inspection of a 
running program. A debugger can start and run a program then stop 
at a specific line for examining the state of the program at that 
point. The point where the debugger stop (but not halt) is called 
a breakpoint.

We will be using the GDB - GNU Debugger for debugging our kernel. 
gdb is the program name. gdb can do four main kinds of things:

• Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its 
  behavior.

• Make your program stop on specified conditions.

• Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped

• Change things in your program, so you can experiment with 
  correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about 
  another

  A sample program

There must be an existing program for debugging. The good old “
Hello World” program suffices for the educational purpose in this 
chapter:

#include <stdio.h>



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("Hello World!\n");

    return 0;

}

We compile it with debugging information with the option -g:



$ gcc -m32 -g hello.c -o hello



Finally, we start gdb with the program as argument:



$ gdb hello



  Static inspection of a program

Before inspecting a program at runtime, gdb loads it first. Upon 
loading into memory (but without running), a lot of useful 
information can be retrieve for inspection. The commands in this 
section can be used before the program runs. However, they are 
also usable when the program runs and can display even more 
information.

  Command: info target/info file/info files

This command prints the information of the target being debugged. 
A target is the debugging program.

The output of the command from hello program, a local target in 
detail:

  

  (gdb) info target

  The output displayed reports:

  • Path of a symbol file. A symbol file is the file that 
    contains the debugging information. Usually, this is the same 
    file as the binary, but it is common to separate between an 
    executable binary and its debugging information into 2 files, 
    especially for remote debugging. In the example, it is this 
    line:

    Symbols from "/tmp/hello".

  • The path of the debugging program and its file type. In the 
    example, it is this line:

    Local exec file:

    	`/tmp/hello', file type elf32-i386.

  • The entry point to the debugging program. That is, the very 
    first code the program runs. In the example, it is this line:

    Entry point: 0x8048310

  • A list of sections with its starting and ending addresses. In 
    the example, it is the remaining output.



If the debugging program runs in a different machine, it is a 
remote target and gdb only prints a brief information:

  

  (gdb) info target

  

  

  Remote serial target in gdb-specific protocol:

  Debugging a target over a serial line.

  



  Command: maint info sections

This command is similar to info target but give extra information 
about program sections, specifically the file offset and the 
flags of each section.

Here is the output when running against hello program:

  

  (gdb) maint info sections

  

  

  Exec file:

      `/tmp/hello', file type elf64-x86-64.

The output is similar to info target, but with more details. Next 
to the section names are the section flags, which are attributes 
of a section. Here, we can see that the sections with LOAD flag 
are from LOAD segment. The command can be combined with the 
section flags for filtered outputs:

  ALLOBJ displays sections for all loaded object files, including 
  shared libraries. Shared libraries are only displayed when the 
  program is already running.

  section names displays only named sections. 

  The command:

    

    (gdb) maint info sections .text .data .bss

    

    only displays .text, .data and .bss sections:

    

    Exec file:

        `/tmp/hello', file type elf64-x86-64.

  section-flags displays only sections with specified section 
  flags. Note that these section flags are specific to gdb, 
  though it is based on the section attributes defined 
  previously. Currently, gdb understands the following flags:

  ALLOC Section will have space allocated in the process when 
    loaded. Set for all sections except those containing debug 
    information. 

  LOAD Section will be loaded from the file into the child 
    process memory. Set for pre-initialized code and data, clear 
    for .bss sections. 

  RELOC Section needs to be relocated before loading. 

  READONLY Section cannot be modified by the child process. 

  CODE Section contains executable code only. 

  DATA Section contains data only (no executable code). 

  ROM Section will reside in ROM. 

  CONSTRUCTOR Section contains data for constructor/destructor 
    lists. 

  HAS_CONTENTS Section is not empty. 

  NEVER_LOAD An instruction to the linker to not output the 
    section. 

  COFF_SHARED_LIBRARY A notification to the linker that the 
    section contains COFF shared library information. COFF is an 
    object file format, similar to ELF. While ELF is the file 
    format for an executable binary, COFF is the file format for 
    an object file.

  IS_COMMON Section contains common symbols.

  We can restrict the output to only display sections that 
  contain code with the command:

    

    (gdb) maint info sections CODE

    

    The output:

    

    Exec file:

        `/tmp/hello', file type elf64-x86-64.

  Command: info functions

This commands list all function names and their loaded addresses. 
The names can be filtered with a regular expression.

Run the command, we get the following output:

  

  (gdb) info functions

  

  

  All defined functions:

  Command: info variables

This command lists all global and static variable names, or 
filtered with a regular expression.

  Command: disassemble/disas

This command displays the assembly code of the executable file. 

gdb can display the assembly code of a function:

  

  (gdb) disassemble main

  Now the high level source (in green text) is included as part 
  of the assembly dump. Each line is backed by the corresponding 
  assembly code below it. 



If the option /r is added, raw instructions in hex are included, 
just like how objdump displays assembly code by default:

  The filename must be included in a single quote, and the 
  function must be prefixed by double colons e.g. 'hello.c'::main 
  to specify disassembling of the function main in the file 
  hello.c.

  Command: x

This command examines the content of a given memory range.

We can examine the raw content of main:

  

  (gdb) x main

  

  

  0x804840b <main>:	0x04244c8d

  

  By default, without any argument, the command only prints the 
  content of a single memory address. In this case, that is the 
  starting memory address of main.



With format arguments, the command can print a range of memory in 
a specific format.

  

  (gdb) x/20b main

  

  

  0x804840b <main>:	   0x8d	0x4c	0x24	0x04	0x83	0xe40xf0	0xff

  0x8048413 <main+8>:	 0x71	0xfc	0x55	0x89	0xe5	0x510x83	0xec

  0x804841b <main+16>:	0x04	0x83	0xec	0x0c

  

  /20b main argument means that the command prints 20 bytes, 
  where main starts in memory.

The general form for format argument is: /<repeated count><format 
letter>

If the repeated count is not supplied, by default gdb supplies 
the count as 1. The format letter is one the following value:


+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Depends on the circumstance, certain format is advantageous than 
the others. For example, if a memory region contains 
floating-point numbers, then it is better to use the format f 
than viewing the number as separated 1-byte hex numbers.

  Command: print/p

Examining raw memory is useful but usually it is better to have a 
more human-readable output. This command does precisely the task: 
it pretty-prints an expression. An expression can be a global 
variable, a local variable in current stack frame, a function, a 
register, a number...

  Runtime inspection of a program

The main use of a debugger is to examine the state of a program, 
when it is running. gdb provides a set of useful commands for 
retrieving useful runtime information.

  Command: run

This command starts running the program.

Run the hello program:

  

  (gdb) r

  

  

  Starting program: /tmp/hello 

  Hello World!

  [Inferior 1 (process 1002) exited normally]

  

  The program runs successfully and printed the message “Hello 
  World”. However, it would not be useful if all gdb can do is 
  run a program.

  Command: break/b

This command sets a breakpoint at a location in the high-level 
source code. When gdb runs to a specific location marked by a 
breakpoint, it stops executing for a programmer to inspect the 
current state of a program.

A breakpoint can be set on a line as displayed by an editor. 
Suppose we want to set a breakpoint at line 3 of the program, 
which is the start of main function:

  #include <stdio.h>



@|\color{red}\bfseries int main(int argc, char *argv[])|@

{

    printf("Hello World!\n");

    return 0;

}

  When running a program, instead of running from start to 
  finish, gdb stopped at line 3:

  

  (gdb) b 3

  

  

  Breakpoint 1 at 0x400535: file hello.c, line 3.

  

  

  (gdb) r

  

  

  Starting program: /tmp/hello 

  Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffdfb8) at hello.c:5

  5	    printf("Hello World!\n");

  

  The breakpoint is at line 3, but gdb stopped line 5. The reason 
  is that line 3 does not contain code, but a function signature; 
  gdb only stops where it can execute code. The code in the 
  function starts at line 5, the call to printf, so gdb stops 
  there.



Line of code is not always the reliable way to specify a 
breakpoint, as the source code can be changed. What if gdb should 
always stop at main function? In this case, a better method is to 
use the function name directly:

  

  b main

  

  Then, regardless of how the source code changes, gdb always 
  stops at the main function.



Sometimes, the debugging program does not contain debug info, or 
gdb is debugging assembly code. In that case, a memory address 
can be specified as a stop point. To get the function address, 
print command can be used:

  

  (gdb) print main

  

  

  $3 = {int (int, char **)} 0x400526 <main>

  

  Knowing the address of main, we can easily set a breakpoint 
  with a memory address:

  

  b *0x400526

  



gdb can also set breakpoint in any source file. Suppose that 
hello program is composed not just one file but many files e.g. 
hello1.c, hello2.c, hello3.c... In that case, simply add the 
filename before either a line number:

  

  b hello.c:3

  



A function name in a specific file can also be set:

  

  b hello.c:main

  

  Command: next/n

This command executes the current line and stops at the next 
line. When the current line is a function call, steps over it.

After setting a breakpoint at main, run a program and stop at the 
first printf:

  

  (gdb) r

  

  

  Starting program: /tmp/hello 

  Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffdfb8) at hello.c:5

  5	    printf("Hello World!\n");

  

  Then, to proceed to the next statement, we use the next 
  command:

  

  (gdb) n

  

  

  Hello World!

  6	    return 0;

  

  In the output, the first line shows the output produced after 
  executing line 5; then, the next line shows where gdb stops 
  currently, which is line 6.

  Command: step/s

This command executes the current line and stops at the next 
line. When the current line is a function call, steps into it to 
the first next line in the called function.

Suppose we have a new function add[footnote:
Why should we add a new function and function call instead of 
using the existing printf call? Stepping into shared library 
functions is tricky because to make debugging works, the debug 
info must be installed and loaded. It is not worth the trouble 
for demonstrating this simple command.
]:

  #include <stdio.h>



int add(int a, int b) {

	return a + b;

}



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

	add(1, 2);

    printf("Hello World!\n");

    return 0;

}

  If step command is used instead of next on the function call 
  printf, gdb steps inside the function:

  

  (gdb) r

  

  

  Starting program: /tmp/hello 

  Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd154) at hello.c:11

  11	    add(1, 2);

  

  

  (gdb) s

  

  

  add (a=1, b=2) at hello.c:6

  6	    return a + b;

  

  After executing the command s, gdb stepped into the add 
  function where the first statement is a return.

  Command: ni

At the core, gdb operates on assembly instruction. Source line by 
line debugging is simply an enhancement to make it friendlier for 
programmers. Each statement in C translates to one or more 
assembly instruction, as shown with objdump and disassemble 
command. With the debug info available, gdb knows how many 
instructions belong to one line of high-level code; line by line 
debugging is just a execution of assembly instructions of a line 
when moving from the current line to the next.

This command executes the one assembly instruction belongs to the 
current line. Until all assembly instructions of the current line 
are executed, gdb will not move to the next line. If the current 
instruction is a call, step over it to the next instruction.

When breakpoint is on the printf call and ni is used, it steps 
through each assembly instruction:

  

  (gdb) disassemble /s main

  

  

  Dump of assembler code for function main:

  End of assembler dump.

  

  

  (gdb) r

  

  

  Starting program: /tmp/hello 

  Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd154) at hello.c:5

  5	    printf("Hello World!\n");

  

  

  (gdb) ni

  

  

  0x0804841f	5	    printf("Hello World!\n");

  

  

  (gdb) ni

  

  

  0x08048424	5	    printf("Hello World!\n");

  

  

  (gdb) ni

  

  

  Hello World!

  0x08048429	5	    printf("Hello World!\n");

  

  

  (gdb)

  

  

  6	    return 0;

  

  Upon entering ni, gdb executes current instruction and display 
  the next instruction. That's why from the output, gdb only 
  displays 3 addresses: 0x0804841f, 0x08048424 and 0x08048429. 
  The instruction at 0x0804841c, which is the first instruction 
  of printf, is not displayed because it is the first instruction 
  that gdb stopped at. Assume that gdb stopped at the first 
  instruction of printf at 0x0804841c, the current instruction 
  can be displayed using x command:

  

  (gdb) x/i $eip

  

  

  => 0x804841c <main+17>: sub    esp,0xc

  

  Command: si

Similar to ni, this command executes the current assembly 
instruction belongs to the current line. But if the current 
instruction is a call, step into it to the first next instruction 
in the called function.

Recall that the assembly code generated from printf contains a 
call instruction:

  

  (gdb) disassemble /s main

  

  

  Dump of assembler code for function main:

  hello.c:

  4	{

     0x0804840b <+0>:	lea    ecx,[esp+0x4]

     0x0804840f <+4>:	and    esp,0xfffffff0

     0x08048412 <+7>:	push   DWORD PTR [ecx-0x4]

     0x08048415 <+10>:	push   ebp

     0x08048416 <+11>:	mov    ebp,esp

     0x08048418 <+13>:	push   ecx

     0x08048419 <+14>:	sub    esp,0x4

  5	    printf("Hello World!\n");

     0x0804841c <+17>:	sub    esp,0xc

     0x0804841f <+20>:	push   0x80484c0

     0x08048424 <+25>:	call   0x80482e0 <puts@plt>

     0x08048429 <+30>:	add    esp,0x10

  6	    return 0;

  => 0x0804842c <+33>:	mov    eax,0x0

  7	}

     0x08048431 <+38>:	mov    ecx,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4]

     0x08048434 <+41>:	leave  

     0x08048435 <+42>:	lea    esp,[ecx-0x4]

     0x08048438 <+45>:	ret    

  End of assembler dump.

  

  We try instruction by instruction stepping again, but this time 
  by running si at 0x08048424, where call resides:

  

  (gdb) si

  

  

  0x0804841f	5	        printf("Hello World!\n");

  

  

  (gdb) si

  

  

  0x08048424	5	        printf("Hello World!\n");

  

  

  (gdb) x/i $eip

  

  

  => 0x8048424 <main+25>:	call   0x80482e0 <puts@plt>

  

  

  (gdb) si

  

  

  0x080482e0 in puts@plt ()

  

  The next instruction right after 0x8048424 is the first 
  instruction at 0x080482e0 in puts function. In other words, gdb 
  stepped into puts instead of stepping over it.

  Command: until

This command executes until the next line is greater than the 
current line.

Suppose we have a function that execute a long loop:

  #include <stdio.h>



int add1000() {

    int total = 0;



    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i){

        total += i;

    }



    printf("Done adding!\n");



    return total;

}



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    add1000(1, 2);

    printf("Hello World!\n");

    return 0;

}

  Using next command, we need to press 1000 times for finishing 
  the loop. Instead, a faster way is to use until: 

  

  (gdb) b add1000

  

  

  Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048411: file hello.c, line 4.

  

  

  (gdb) r

  

  

  Starting program: /tmp/hello 

  Breakpoint 1, add1000 () at hello.c:4

  4	    int total = 0;

  

  

  (gdb) until

  

  

  5	    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i){

  

  

  (gdb) until

  

  

  6	        total += i;

  

  

  (gdb) until

  

  

  5	    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i){

  

  

  (gdb) until

  

  

  8	    printf("Done adding!\n");

  

  Executing the first until, gdb stopped at line 5 since line 5 
  is greater than line 4. 

  Executing the second until, gdb stopped at line 6 since line 6 
  is greater than line 5.

  Executing the third until, gdb stopped at line 5 since the loop 
  still continues. Because line 5 is less than line 6, with the 
  fourth until, gdb kept executing until it does not go back to 
  line 5 anymore and stopped at line 8. This is a great way to 
  skip over loop in the middle, instead of setting unneeded 
  breakpoint.

  until can be supplied with an argument to explicitly execute to 
  a specific line:

  

  (gdb) r

  

  

  Starting program: /tmp/hello 

  Breakpoint 1, add1000 () at hello.c:4

  4	    int total = 0;

  

  

  (gdb) until 8

  

  

  add1000 () at hello.c:8

  8	    printf("Done adding!\n");

  

  Command: finish

This command executes until the end of a function and displays 
the return value. finish is actually just a more convenient 
version of until.

Using the add1000 function from the previous example and use 
finish instead of until:

  

  (gdb) r

  

  

  Starting program: /tmp/hello 

  Breakpoint 1, add1000 () at hello.c:4

  4	    int total = 0;

  

  

  (gdb) finish

  

  

  Run till exit from #0  add1000 () at hello.c:4

  Done adding!

  0x08048466 in main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd154) at hello.c:15

  15	    add1000(1, 2);

  Value returned is $1 = 499500

  

  Command: bt

This command prints the backtrace of all stack frames. A [margin:
backtrace
]backtracebacktrace is a list of currently active functions:

Suppose we have a chain of function calls:

  void d(int d) { };

void c(int c) { d(0); }

void b(int b) { c(1); }

void a(int a) { b(2); }



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    a(3);

    return 0;

}

  bt can visualize such a chain in action:

  

  (gdb) b a

  

  

  Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048404: file hello.c, line 9.

  

  

  (gdb) r

  

  

  Starting program: /tmp/hello 

  Breakpoint 1, a (a=3) at hello.c:9

  9	void a(int a) { b(2); }

  

  

  (gdb) s

  

  

  b (b=2) at hello.c:7

  7	void b(int b) { c(1); }

  

  

  (gdb) s

  

  

  c (c=1) at hello.c:5

  5	void c(int c) { d(0); }

  

  

  (gdb) s

  

  

  d (d=0) at hello.c:3

  3	void d(int d) { };

  

  

  (gdb) bt

  

  

  #0  d (d=0) at hello.c:3

  #1  0x080483eb in c (c=1) at hello.c:5

  #2  0x080483fb in b (b=2) at hello.c:7

  #3  0x0804840b in a (a=3) at hello.c:9

  #4  0x0804841b in main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd154) at hello.c:13

  

  Most-recent calls are placed on top and least-recent calls are 
  near the bottom. In this case, d is the most current active 
  function, so it has the index 0. Next is c, the 2[superscript:nd] active function, has the index 1 and so on with function b, 
  function a, and finally function main at the bottom, the 
  least-recent function. That is how we read a backtrace.

  Command: up

This command goes up one frame earlier the current frame.

Instead of staying in d function, we can go up to c function and 
look at its state:

  

  (gdb) bt

  

  

  #0  d (d=0) at hello.c:3

  #1  0x080483eb in c (c=1) at hello.c:5

  #2  0x080483fb in b (b=2) at hello.c:7

  #3  0x0804840b in a (a=3) at hello.c:9

  #4  0x0804841b in main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd154) at hello.c:13

  

  

  (gdb) up

  

  

  #1  0x080483eb in c (c=1) at hello.c:3

  3	void b(int b) { c(1); }

  

  The output displays the current frame is moved to c and where 
  the call to c is made, which is in function b at line 3.

  Command: down

Similar to up, this command goes down one frame later then the 
current frame.

After inspecting c function, we can go back to d:

  

  (gdb) bt

  

  

  #0  d (d=0) at hello.c:3

  #1  0x080483eb in c (c=1) at hello.c:5

  How debuggers work: A brief introduction

  How breakpoints work

When a programmer places a breakpoint somewhere in his code, what 
actually happens is that the first opcode of the first 
instruction of a statement is replaced with another instruction, 
int 3 with opcode CCh:

[float Figure:
[Figure 0.17:
Opcode replacement, with int 3
]

     
+-----+-----+---------+                +-----+-----+----+
| 83  | ec  |   0c    |  \rightarrow
  | cc  | ec  | 0c |
+-----+-----+---------+                +-----+-----+----+
+---------------------+                +----------------+
|     sub esp,0x4     |                |     int 3      |
+---------------------+                +----------------+
     
]

int 3 only costs a single byte, making it efficient for 
debugging. When int 3 instruction is executed, the operating 
system calls its breakpoint interrupt handler. The handler then 
checks what process reaches a breakpoint, pauses it and notifies 
the debugger it has paused a debugged process. The debugged 
process is only paused and that means a debugger is free to 
inspect its internal state, like a surgeon operates on an 
anesthetic patient. Then, the debugger replaces the int 3 opcode 
with the original opcode and executes the original instruction 
normally.

It is simple to see int 3 in action. First, we add an int 3 
instruction where we need gdb to stop:

  #include <stdio.h>



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    asm("int 3");

    printf("Hello World\n");

    return 0;

}

  int 3 precedes printf, so gdb is expected to stop at printf. 
  Next, we compile with debug enable and with Intel syntax:

  

  $ gcc -masm=intel -m32 -g hello.c -o hello

  

  Finally, start gdb:

  

  $ gdb hello

  

  Running without setting any breakpoint, gdb stops at printf 
  call, as expected:

  

  (gdb) r

  

  

  Starting program: /tmp/hello 

  Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.

  main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd154) at hello.c:6

  6	    printf("Hello World\n");

  

  The blue text indicates that gdb encountered a breakpoint, and 
  indeed it stopped at the right place: the printf call, where 
  int 3 preceded it.

  Single stepping

When breakpoint is implemented, it is easy to implement single 
stepping: a debugger simply places another int 3 opcode in the 
next instruction. So, when a programmer sets a breakpoint at an 
instruction, the next instruction is automatically set by the 
debugger, thus enable instruction by instruction debugging. 
Similarly, source line by line debugging is just the placements 
of the very first opcodes in the two statements with two int 3 
opcodes.

  How a debugger understands high level source code

DWARF is a debugging file format used by many compilers and 
debuggers to support source level debugging. DWARF contains 
information that maps between entities in the executable binary 
with the source files. A program entity can either be data or 
code. A DIE, or [margin:
Debugging Information Entry
]Debugging Information EntryDebugging Information Entry, is a 
description of a program entity. A DIE consists of a 
tag, which specifies the entity 
that the DIE describes, and a list of  attributes that describes 
the entity. Of all the attributes, these two attributes enables 
source-level debugging: 

• Where the entity appears in the source files: which file and 
  which line the entity appears.

• Where the entity appears in the executable binary: in which 
  memory address the entity is loaded at runtime. With the 
  precise address, gdb can retrieve correct value for a data 
  entity, or place a correct breakpoint and stop accordingly for 
  a code entity. Without the information of these addresses, gdb 
  would not know where the entities are to inspect them.

In addition to DIEs, another binary-to-source mapping is the line 
number table. The line number table maps between a line in the 
source code and at which memory address is the start of the line 
in the executable binary.

In sum, to successfully enable source-level debugging, a debugger 
needs to know the precise location of the source files and the 
load addresses at runtime. Address matching, between the image 
layout of the ELF binary and the address where it is loaded, is 
extremely important since debug information relies on correct 
loading address at runtime. That is, it assumes the addresses as 
recorded in the binary image at compile-time the same as at 
runtime e.g. if the load address for .text section is recorded in 
the executable binary at 0x800000, then when the binary actually 
runs, .text should really be loaded at 0x800000 for gdb to be 
able to correctly match running instructions with high-level code 
statement. Address mismatching makes debug information useless, 
as actual code at one address is displayed as code at another 
address. Without this knowledge, we will not be able to build an 
operating system that can be debugged with gdb.

When an executable binary contains debug info, readelf can 
display such information in a readable format. Using the good old 
hello world program:

  #include <stdio.h>



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("Hello World\n");



    return 0;

}

  and compile with debug info:

  

  $ gcc -m32 -g hello.c -o hello

  

  With the binary ready, we can look at the line number table 
  with the command:

  

  $ readlelf -wL hello

  

  -w option prints all the debug information. In combination with 
  its sub-option, only specific information is displayed. For 
  example, with -L, only the line number table is displayed:

  

  Decoded dump of debug contents of section .debug_line:

  CU: hello.c:

  File name                            Line number    Starting 
  address

  hello.c                                        6           
  0x804840b

  hello.c                                        7           
  0x804841c

  hello.c                                        9           
  0x804842c

  hello.c                                       10           
  0x8048431

  

  From the above output:

  CU shorts for Compilation Unit, a 
    separately compiled source file. In the example, we only have 
    one file, hello.c.

  File name displays the filename of the current compilation 
    unit.

  Line number is the line number in the source file of which the 
    line is not an empty line. In the example, line 8 is an empty 
    line, so it does not appear.

  Starting address is the memory address where the line actually 
    starts in the executable binary. 

  With such crystal clear information, this is how gdb is able to 
  set a breakpoint on a line easily. For placing breakpoints on 
  variables and functions, it is time to look at the DIEs. To get 
  the DIEs information from an executable binary, run the 
  command:

  

  $ readlelf -wi hello

  

  -wi option lists all the DIE entries. This is one typical DIE 
  entry:

   <0><b>: Abbrev Number: 1 (DW_TAG_compile_unit)

      <c>   DW_AT_producer    : (indirect string, offset: 0xe): 
  GNU C11 5.4.0 20160609 -masm=intel -m32 -mtune=generic 
  -march=i686 -g -fstack-protector-strong

      <10>   DW_AT_language    : 12	(ANSI C99)

      <11>   DW_AT_name        : (indirect string, offset: 0xbe): 
  hello.c

      <15>   DW_AT_comp_dir    : (indirect string, offset: 0x97): 
  /tmp

      <19>   DW_AT_low_pc      : 0x804840b

      <1d>   DW_AT_high_pc     : 0x2e

      <21>   DW_AT_stmt_list   : 0x0

  Red This left-most number indicates the current nesting level 
    of a DIE entry. 0 is the outer-most level DIE with its entity 
    is the compilation unit. This means subsequent DIE entries 
    with higher nesting level are all the children of this tag, 
    the compilation unit. It makes sense, as all the entities 
    must originate from a source file.

  Blue These numbers in hex format indicate the offsets into 
    .debug_info section. Each meaningful information is displayed 
    along with its offset. When an attribute references to 
    another attribute, the offset is used to precisely identify 
    the referenced attribute.

  Green These names with DW_AT_ prefix are the attributes 
    attached to a DIE that describe an entity. Notable 
    attributes:

    DW_AT_name

    DW_AT_comp_dir The filename of the compilation unit and the 
      directory where compilation occurred. Without the filename 
      and the path, gdb would not be able to display the 
      high-level source, despite the availability of the debug 
      info. Debug info only contains the mapping between source 
      and binary, not the source code itself.

    DW_AT_low_pc

    DW_AT_high_pc The start and end of the current entity, which 
      is the compilation unit, in the executable binary. The 
      value in DW_AT_low_pc is the starting address. 
      DW_AT_high_pc is the size of the compilation unit, when 
      adding up to DW_AT_low_pc results in the end address of the 
      entity. In this example, code compiled from hello.c starts 
      at 0x804840b and end at \mathtt{0x804840b+0x2e=0x8048439}
. 
      To really make sure, we verify with objdump:

       804843b:       66 90                   xchg   ax,ax

       804843d:       66 90                   xchg   ax,ax

       804843f:       90                      nop

      

      It is true: main starts at 804840b and end at 8048439, 
      right after the ret instruction at 8048438. The 
      instructions after 8048439 are just padding bytes inserted 
      by gcc for alignment, which do not belong to main. Note 
      that the output from objdump shows much more code past 
      main. It is not counted, as the code is outside of hello.c, 
      added by gcc for the operating system. hello.c contains 
      only one function: main and this is why hello.c also starts 
      and ends the same as main.

  Pink This number displays the abbreviation form of a tag. An 
    abbreviation is the form of a DIE. When debug info is 
    displayed with -wi, the DIEs are displayed with their values. 
    -wa option shows abbreviations in the .debug_abbrev section:

    

    Contents of the .debug_abbrev section:

      Number TAG (0x0)

       1      DW_TAG_compile_unit    [has children]

        DW_AT value: 0     DW_FORM value: 0

    .... more abbreviations ....

    

    The output is similar to a DIE output, with only attribute 
    names and without any value. We can also say an abbreviation 
    is a type of a DIE, as an abbreviation represents the 
    structure of a particular DIE. Many DIEs share the same 
    abbreviation, or structure, thus they are of the same type. 
    An abbreviation number specifies which type a DIE is in the 
    abbreviation table above. Abbreviations improve encoding 
    efficiency (reduce binary size) because each DIE needs not to 
    carry their structure information as pairs of attribute-value[footnote:
For example, data format such as YAML or JSON encodes its 
attribute names along with its values. This simplifies encoding, 
but with overhead.
], but simply refers to an abbreviation for correct decoding.

  Here are all the DIEs of hello represented as a tree:

  

  <Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/06/dwarf_tree.svg>
  <dwarf_tree>

  

In the figure [dwarf_tree], DW_TAG_subprogram represents a 
function such as main. Its children are the DIEs of argc and 
argv. With such precise information, matching source to binary is 
an easy job for gdb.

If more than one compilation units exist in an executable binary, 
the DIE entries are sorted according to the compilation order 
from gcc. For example, suppose we have another test.c source file[footnote:
It can contain anything. Just a sample file.
] and compile it together with hello:



$ gcc -masm=intel -m32 -g test.c hello.c -o hello



Then, the all DIE entries in test.c are displayed before the DIE

Bootloader<chap:Bootloader>

A bootloader loads an OS, or an application [footnote:
Many embedded devices don't use an OS. In embedded systems, the 
bootloader is simply included in boot firmware and no bootloader 
is needed. 
] that runs and communicate directly with hardware. To run an OS, 
the first thing to write is a bootloader. In this chapter, we are 
going to write a rudimentary bootloader, as our main focus is 
writing an operating system, not a bootloader. More 
interestingly, this chapter will present related tools and 
techniques that are applicable for writing a bootloader as well 
as an operating system.

  x86 Boot Process

After the POST process finished, the CPU's program counter is set 
to the address FFFF:0000h for executing BIOS code. BIOS - Basic 
Input/Output System is a firmware that performs hardware 
initialization and provides a set of generic subroutines to 
control input/output devices. The BIOS checks all available 
storage devices (floppy disks and hard disks) if any device is 
bootable, by examining the last two bytes of the first sector 
whether it has the boot record signature of 0x55, 0xAA. If so, 
the BIOS loads the first sector to the address 7C00h, set the 
program counter to that address and let the CPU executing code 
from there.

The first sector is called Master Boot Record, or MBR. The 
program in the first sector is called MBR Bootloader.

  Using BIOS services

BIOS provides many basic services for controlling the hardware at 
the boot stage. A service is a group of routines that controls a 
particular hardware device, or returns information of current 
system. Each service is given an interrupt number. To call a BIOS 
routine, an int instruction must be used with an interrupt 
number. Each BIOS service defines its own numbers for its 
routines; to call a routine, a specific number must be written to 
a register required by each service. The list of all BIOS 
interrupts is available with Ralf Brown's Interrupt List at: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ralf/files.html
.

[float Figure:


[Figure 0.19:
The boot process.
]

     <Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/07/simple_boot_process.pdf>
     
]

  Example: Interrupt call 13h (diskette service) requires number 
  of sectors to read, track number, sector number, head number 
  and drive number to read from a storage device. The content of 
  the sector is stored in memory at the address defined by the 
  pair of registers ES:BX. The parameters are stored in registers 
  like this:

  ; Store sector content in the buffer 10FF:0000

mov     dx, 10FFh

mov     es, dx

xor     bx, bx

mov     al, 2    ; read 2 sector

mov     ch, 0    ; read track 0

mov     cl, 2    ; 2nd sector is read

mov     dh, 0    ; head number

mov     dl, 0    ; drive number. Drive 0 is floppy drive.

mov     ah, 0x02 ; read floppy sector function

int     0x13     ; call BIOS - Read the sector

The BIOS is only available in real mode. However, when switching 
to protected mode, then BIOS will not be usable anymore and the 
operating system code is responsible for controlling hardware 
devices. This is when the operating system stands on its own: it 
must provide its own kernel drivers for talking to hardware.

  Boot process

1. BIOS transfers control to MBR bootloader by jumping to 
  0000:7c00h, where bootloader is assumed to exist already.

2. Setup machine environment for booting by properly initialize 
  segment registers to enable flat memory model.

3. Load the kernel:

  (a) Read kernel from disk.

  (b) Save it somewhere in the main memory.

  (c) Jump to the starting code address of the kernel and 
    execute.

4. If error occurs, print a message to notify users something 
  went wrong and halt.

  Example Bootloader

Here is a simple bootloader that does nothing, except not 
crashing the machine but halt it gracefully. If the virtual 
machine does not halt but text repeatedly flashing, it means the 
bootloader does not load properly and the machine crashed. The 
machine crashed because it keeps executing until the near end of 
physical memory (1 MB in real mode), which is FFFF:0000h, which 
starts the whole BIOS boot process all over again. This is 
effectively a reset, but not fully, since machine environment 
from previous run is still reserved. For that reason, it is 
called a warm reboot. The opposite of warm reboot is cold reboot, 
in which the machine environment is reset to initial settings 
when the computer starts from a powerless state.

  Compile and load

We compile the code with nasm and write it to a disk image:



$ nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o bootloader



Then, we create a 1.4 MB floppy disk and:



$ dd if=/dev/zero of=disk.img bs=512 count=2880





2880+0 records in

2880+0 records out

1474560 bytes (1.5 MB, 1.4 MiB) copied, 0.00625622 s, 236 MB/s



Then, we write the bootloader to the 1[superscript:st]sector:



$ dd conv=notrunc if=bootloader of=disk.img bs=512 count=1 seek=0





1+0 records in

1+0 records out

512 bytes copied, 0.000102708 s, 5.0 MB/s



The option conv=notrunc preserves the original size of the floppy 
disk. Without this option, the 1.4 MB disk image will be 
completely replaced by the new disk.img with only 512 bytes, and 
we do not want that happens. 

In the past, developing an operating system is complicated 
because a programmer needs to understand specific hardware he is 
using. Even though x86 was ubiquitous, the minute differences 
between models made some code written for a machine not run on 
another. Further, if you use the same physical computer you write 
your operating system take very long between runs, and also 
difficult to debug. Fortunately, today we can uniformly produce a 
virtual machine with a particular specification and avoid the 
incompatibility issue altogether, thus making an OS easier to 
write and test since everyone can reproduce the same machine 
environment. 

We will be using QEMU, a generic and open source machine emulator 
and virtualizer. QEMU can emulate various types of machine, not 
limited to x86_64 only. Debug is easy since you can connect GDB 
to a virtual machine to debug code that runs on it, through 
QEMU's built-in GDB server. QEMU can use disk.img as a boot 
device e.g. a floppy disk:



$ qemu-system-i386 -machine q35 -fda disk.img -gdb tcp::26000 -S



• With option -machine q35, QEMU emulates a q35 machine model 
  from Intel.[footnote:
The following command lists all supported emulated machines from 
QEMU:

qemu-system-i386 -machine help
].

• With option -fda disk.img, QEMU uses disk.img as a floppy disk 
  image.

• With option -gdb tcp::26000, QEMU allows gdb to connect to the 
  virtual machine for remote debugging through a tcp socket with 
  port 26000.

• With option -S, QEMU waits for gdb to connect before it starts 
  running.

After the command is executed, a new console window that displays 
the screen output of the virtual machine. Open another terminal, 
run gdb and set the current architecture to i386, since we are 
running in 16-bit mode:



(gdb) set architecture i8086





warning: A handler for the OS ABI "GNU/Linux" is not built into 
this configuration

of GDB. Attempting to continue with the default i8086 settings.

The target architecture is assumed to be i8086



Then, connect gdb to the waiting virtual machine with this 
command:



(gdb) target remote localhost:26000





Remote debugging using localhost:26000

0x0000fff0 in ?? ()



Then, place a breakpoint at 0x7c00:



(gdb) b *0x7c00





Breakpoint 1 at 0x7c00



Note the before the memory address. Without the asterisk, gdb 
treats the address as a symbol in a program rather than an 
address. Then, for convenience, we use a split layout for viewing 
the assembly code and registers together:



(gdb) layout asm

(gdb) layout reg



Finally, run the program:



(gdb) c



If the virtual machine successfully runs the bootloader, this is 
what the QEMU screen should look like:

[float Figure:
[Figure 0.20:
Boot succeeded.
]

<Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/07/boot_succeeded.png>
]

  Debugging

If, for some reason, the sample bootloader cannot get to such 
screen and gdb does not stop at 0x7c00, then the following 
scenarios are likely:

• The bootloader is invalid: the message “Boot failed: not a 
  bootable disk” appears for floppy disk booting. Make sure the 
  boot signature is at the last 2 bytes of the 512-byte first 
  sector.

• The machine cannot find a boot disk: the message “Boot failed: 
  not a bootable disk” appears for floppy disk booting. Make sure 
  the bootloader is correctly written to the first sector. It can 
  be verify by check the disk with hd:

  

  $ hd disk.img | less

  

  If the first 512 bytes are all zeroes, then it is likely that 
  the bootloader is incorrectly written to another sector.

• The machine crashes: When such scenario happens, it reset back 
  to the beginning at FFFF:0000h. If the QEMU machine starts 
  without waiting for gdb, then the console output window keeps 
  flashing as the machine is repeatedly reset. It is likely some 
  instruction in the bootloader code causing the fault.


-------------------------------------------


Print a welcome message

  We loaded the bootloader successfully. But, it needs to do 
  something useful other than halting our machine. The easiest 
  thing to do is printing something on screen, like how an 
  introduction to all programming language starts with “Hello 
  World”. Our bootloader prints “Welcome to my operating system”[footnote:
Or whatever message you want.
]. In this part, we will build a simple I/O library that allows 
  us to set a cursor anywhere on the screen and print text there.

  First, create a file io.asm for I/O related routines. Then, 
  write the following routines:

  1. MovCursor 

    Purpose: Move a cursor to a specific location on screen and 
    remember this location.

    Parameters: 

    • bh = Y coordinate

    • bl = X coordinate. 

    Return: None

  2. PutChar 

    Purpose: Print a character on screen, at the cursor position 
    previously set by MovCursor .

    Parameters:

    • al = Character to print

    • bl = text color

    • cx = number of times the character is repeated

    Return: None

  3. Print 

    Purpose: Print a string.

    Parameters:

    • ds:si = Zero terminated string

    Return: None

  Test the routines by putting each in the bootloader source, 
  compile and run. To debug, run GDB and set a breakpoint at a 
  specific routine. The end result is that Print should display a 
  welcome message on screen.


-------------------------------------------


  Loading a program from bootloader

Now that we get the feel of how to use the BIOS services, it is 
time for something more complicated. We will place our kernel on 
2[superscript:nd] sector onward, and our bootloader reads 30 sectors starting from 
2[superscript:nd] sector. Why 30 sectors? Our kernel will grow gradually, so we 
will preserve 30 sectors and save us time for modifying the 
bootloader each time the kernel size expands another sector.

The primary responsibility of a bootloader is to read an 
operating system from some storage device e.g. hard disk, then 
loads it into main memory and transfer the control to the loaded 
operating system, similar to how the BIOS reads and loads a 
bootloader. At the moment, our bootloader does nothing more than 
just an assembly program loaded by the BIOS. To make our 
bootloader a real one, it must perform well the above two tasks: 
read and load an operating system.

  Floppy Disk Anatomy

To read from a storage device, we must understand how the device 
works, and the provided interface for controlling it. First of 
all, a floppy disk is a storage device, similar to RAM, but can 
store information even when a computer is turned off, thus is 
called persistent storage device[margin:
persistent storage device
]persistent storage device. A floppy disk also a persistent 
storage device, thus it provides a storage space up to 1.4 MB, or 
1,474,560 bytes. When reading from a floppy disk, the smallest 
unit that can be read is a sectorsector, a group of 512 
contiguous bytes. A group of 18 sectors is a tracktrack. Each 
side of a floppy disk consists of 80 tracks. A floppy drive is 
required to read a floppy disk. Inside a floppy drive contains an 
arm with 2 heads, each head reads a side of a floppy drive; head 
0 writes the upper side and head 1 writes the lower side of a 
floppy disk.

[float MarginFigure:


[MarginFigure 8:
Sector and Track.
]

     <Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/07/Disk-structure.pdf>
     
]

When a floppy drive writes data to a brand new floppy disk, track 
0 on the upper side is written first, by head 0. When the upper 
track 0 is full, the lower track 0 is used by head 1. When both 
the upper and lower side of a track 0 are full, it goes back to 
head 0 for writing data again, but this time the upper side of 
track 1 and so on, until no space left on the device. The same 
procedure is also applied for reading data from floppy disk.[float MarginFigure:


[MarginFigure 9:
Floppy disk platter with 2 sides.
]

<Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/07/Disk_heads.pdf>
]

  Read and load sectors from a floppy disk<sub:Read-and-load>

First, we need to a sample program for writing into the 2[superscript:nd] sector, so we can experiment with floppy disk reading:

;******************************************

; sample.asm		

; A Sample Program

;******************************************

mov eax, 1

add eax, 1

Such a program is good enough. To simplify and for the purpose of 
demonstration, we will use the same floppy disk that holds the 
bootloader to hold our operating system. The operating system 
image starts from the 2[superscript:nd] sector, as the 1[superscript:st] sector is already in use by the bootloader. We compile and write 
it to the 2[superscript:nd] sector with dd:



$ nasm -f bin sample.asm -o sample

$ dd if=sample of=disk.img bs=512 count=1 seek=0



[float Figure:


[Figure 0.21:
The bootloader and the sample program on floppy disk.
]

     
+---------------------------+---------------------------+------------+---------------------------+
| 1[superscript:st] sector  | 2[superscript:nd] sector  |   .....    | 30[superscript:th] sector |
+---------------------------+---------------------------+------------+---------------------------+
|        bootloader         |          sample           |   ....     |          (empty)          |
+---------------------------+---------------------------+------------+---------------------------+
     
]

Next, we need to fix the bootloader for reading from the floppy 
disk and load a number of arbitrary sectors. Before doing so, a 
basic understanding of floppy disk is required. To read data from 
disk, interrupt 13 with AH = 02 is a routine for reading sectors 
from disk into memory:

AH = 02

AL = number of sectors to read (1-128 dec.)

CH = track/cylinder number (0-1023 dec., see below)

CL = sector number (1-17 dec.)

DH = head number (0-15 dec.)

DL = drive number (0=A:, 1=2nd floppy, 80h=drive 0, 81h=drive 1)

ES:BX = pointer to buffer



Return:

   AH = status (see INT 13,STATUS)

   AL = number of sectors read

   CF = 0 if successful

      = 1 if error

Apply the above routine, the bootloader can read the 2[superscript:nd] sector:

  hlt	; halt the system



  ; We have to be 512 bytes. Clear the rest of the bytes with 0

times 510 - ($-$$) db 0

dw 0xAA55				  ; Boot Signiture

The above code jumps to the address 0x50:00 (which is 0x500). To 
test the code, load it on a QEMU virtual machine and connect 
through gdb, then place a breakpoint at 0x500. If gdb stops at 
the address, with the assembly listing is the same code as in 
sample.asm, then the bootloader successfully loaded the program. 
This is an important milestone, as we ensure that our operating 
system are loaded and ran properly.

  Improve productivity with scripts

  Automate build with GNU Make

Up to this point, the whole development process felt repetitive: 
whenever a change is made, the same commands are entered again. 
The commands are also complex. Ctrl+r helps, but it still feels 
tedious. 

GNU Make is a program that controls and automates the process of 
building a complex software. For a small program, like a single C 
source file, invoking gcc is quick and easy. However, soon your 
software will be more complex, with multiples spanning multiple 
directories, it is a chore to manually build and link files. To 
solve such problem, a tool was created to automate away this 
problem and is called a build system. GNU Make is one such of 
tools. There are various build systems out there, but GNU Make is 
the most popular in Linux world, as it is used for building the 
Linux kernel.

For a comprehensive introduction to make, please refer to the 
official Introduction to Make: 
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html#Introduction
. And that's enough for our project. You can also download the 
manual in different formats e.g. PDF from the official manual 
page: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/ .

With Makefile, we can build simpler commands and save time:

all: bootloader bootdisk



bootloader:

	nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o bootloader.o



kernel:

	nasm -f bin sample.asm -o bootloader.o



bootdisk: bootloader.o kernel.o

	dd if=/dev/zero of=disk.img bs=512 count=2880

	dd conv=notrunc if=bootloader.o of=disk.img bs=512 count=1 
seek=0

	dd conv=notrunc if=sample.o of=disk.img bs=512 count=1 seek=1

Now, with a single command, we can build from start to finish a 
disk image with a bootloader at 1[superscript:st]sector and the sample program at 2[superscript:nd]sector:



$ make bootdisk





nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o bootloader.o

nasm -f bin sample.asm -o bootloader.o

dd if=/dev/zero of=disk.img bs=512 count=2880

2880+0 records in

2880+0 records out

0+1 records in

0+1 records out

10 bytes copied, 0.000208375 s, 48.0 kB/s



Looking at the Makefile, we can see a few problems: 

First, the name disk.img are all over the place. When we want to 
change the disk image name e.g. floppy_disk.img, all the places 
with the name disk.img must be changed manually. To solve this 
problem, we use a variable, and every appearance of disk.img is 
replaced with the reference to the variable. This way, only one 
place that is changed - the variable definition - all other 
places are updated automatically. The following variables are 
added:

BOOTLOADER=bootloader.o

OS=sample.o

DISK_IMG=disk.img.o

The second problem is, the name bootloader and sample appears as 
part of the filenames of the source files e.g. bootloader.asm and 
sample.asm, as well as the filenames of the binary files e.g. 
bootloader and sample. Similar to disk.img, when a name changed, 
every reference of that name must also be changed manually for 
both the names of the source files and the names of the binary 
files e.g. if we change bootloader.asm to loader.asm, then the 
object file bootloader.o needs changing to loader.o. To solve 
this problem, instead of changing filenames manually, we create a 
rule that automatically generate the filenames of one extension 
to another. In this case, we want any source file that starts 
with .asm to have its equivalent binary files, without any 
extension e.g. bootloader.asm \rightarrow
 bootloader.o. Such 
transformation is common, so GNU Make provides built-in 
functions: wildcard and patsubst for solving such problems:

BOOTLOADER_SRCS := $(wildcard *.asm)

BOOTLOADER_OBJS := $(patsubst %.asm, %.o, $(BOOTLOADER_SRCS))

wildcard matches any .asm file in the current directory, then 
assigned the list of matched files into the variable 
BOOTLOADER_SRCS. In this case, BOOTLOADER_SRCS is assigned the 
value: 

bootloader.asm sample.asm

patsubst substitutes any filename starts with .asm into a 
filename .o e.g. bootloader.asm \rightarrow
 bootloader.o. After 
patsubsts runs, we get a list of object files in BOOTLOADER_OBJS:

bootloader.o sample.o

Finally, a recipe for building from .asm to .o are needed:

%.o: %.asm

	nasm -f bin $< -o $@

• $< is a special variable that refers to the input of the 
  recipe: %.asm.

• $@ is a special variable that refers to the output of the 
  recipe: %.o.

When the recipe is executed, the variables are replaced with the 
actual values. For example, if a transformation is bootloader.asm 
\rightarrow
 bootloader.o, then the actual command executed when 
replace the placeholders in the recipe is: 

nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o bootloader.o

With the recipe, all the .asm files are built automatically with 
the nasm command into .o files and we no longer need a separate 
recipe for each object files. Putting it all together with the 
new variables, we get a better Makefile:

BOOTLOADER=bootloader.o

OS=sample.o

DISK_IMG=disk.img



BOOTLOADER_SRCS := $(wildcard *.asm)

BOOTLOADER_OBJS := $(patsubst %.asm, %.o, $(BOOTLOADER_SRCS))



all: bootdisk



%.o: %.asm

	nasm -f bin $< -o $@



bootdisk:  $(BOOTLOADER_OBJS)

	dd if=/dev/zero of=$(DISK_IMG) bs=512 count=2880

	dd conv=notrunc if=$(BOOTLOADER) of=$(DISK_IMG) bs=512 count=1 
seek=0

	dd conv=notrunc if=$(OS) of=$(DISK_IMG) bs=512 count=1 seek=1

From here on, any .asm file is compiled automatically, without an 
explicit recipe for each file. 

The object files are in the same directory as the source files, 
making it more difficult when working with the source tree. 
Ideally, object files and source files should live in different 
directories. We want a better organized directory layout like 
Figure [project-layout].[float MarginFigure:

bootloader/ directory holds bootloader source files; os/ holds 
operating system source files that we are going to write later; 
build/ holds the object files for both the bootloader, the os and 
the final disk image disk.img. Notice that bootloader/ directory 
also has its own Makefile. This Makefile will be responsible for 
building everything in bootloader/ directory, while the top-level 
Makefile is released from the burden of building the bootloader, 
but only the disk image. The content of the Makefile in 
bootloader/ directory should be:

BUILD_DIR=@|\color{blue}\bfseries ../build/|@bootloader



BOOTLOADER_SRCS := $(wildcard *.asm)

BOOTLOADER_OBJS := $(patsubst %.asm, $(BUILD_DIR)/%.o,

Basically everything related to the bootloader in the top-level 
Makefile are extracted into this Makefile. When make runs this 
Makefile, bootloader.o should be built and put into ../build/ 
directory. As a good practice, all references to ../build/ go 
through BUILD_DIR variable. The recipe for transforming from .asm 
\rightarrow
 .o is also updated with proper paths, else it will 
not work. 

• %.asm refers to the assembly source files in the current 
  directory.

• $(BUILD_DIR)/%.o refers to the output object files in the build 
  directory in the path ../build/.

The entire recipe implements the transformation from 
<source_file.asm> \rightarrow
 ../build/<object_file.o>. Note 
that all paths must be correct. If we try to build object files 
in a different directory e.g. current directory, it will not work 
since there is no such recipe exists to build objects at such a 
path.

We also create a similar Makefile for os/ directory:[float MarginFigure:

	nasm -f bin $< -o $@

For now, it looks almost identical to the Makefile for 
bootloader. In the next chapter, we will update it for C code. 
Then, we update the top-level Makefile:[float MarginFigure:

	dd conv=notrunc if=$(OS) of=$(DISK_IMG) bs=512 count=1 seek=1

The build process is now truly modularized:

• bootloader and os builds are now delegated to child Makefile of 
  respective components. -C option tells make to execute with a 
  Makefile in a supplied directory. In this case, the directories 
  are bootloader/ and os/.

• The target all of the top-level Makefile is only responsible 
  for bootdisk target, which is the primary target of this 
  Makefile. 

In many cases, a target is not always a filename, but is just a 
name for a recipe to be always executed when requested. If a 
filename is of the same name as a target and the file is 
up-to-date, make does not execute the target. To solve this 
problem, .PHONY specifies that some targets are not files. All 
phony targets will then run when requested, regardless of files 
of the same names.

To save time entering the command for starting up a QEMU virtual 
machine, we also add a target to the top-level Makefile:

qemu:

	qemu-system-i386 -machine q35 -fda $(DISK_IMG) -gdb tcp::26000 
-S

One last problem is project cleaning. At the moment, object files 
need removing manually and this is a repetitive process. Instead, 
let the Makefile of each component takes care of cleaning its 
object files, then top-level Makefile performs project cleaning 
by calling the component Makefile to do the jobs. Each Makefile 
is added with a clean target at the end:

• Bootloader Makefile:

  clean:

	rm $(BUILD_DIR)/*

• OS Makefile:

  clean:

	rm $(BUILD_DIR)/*

• Top-level Makefile:

  clean:

	make -C bootloader clean

	make -C os clean

Simply invoking make clean at the project root, all object files 
the are removed.

  GNU Make Syntax summary

GNU Make, at its core, is a domain-specific language for build 
automation. As any programming language, it needs a way to define 
data and code. In a Makefile, variables carry data. A variable 
value is either hard coded or evaluated from invoking a shell 
such as Bash. All variable values in Make has the same type: a 
string of text. Number 3 is not a number, but textual 
representation of the symbol 3. Here are common ways how to 
define data in a Makefile:


+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

B = 2

C = $$(expr $(A) + $(B))


⇒ A is 1, B is 2, C is 3.                             | Declare a variable and assign a textual value to it. the double 
dollar sign $$ means the enclosing expression evaluating by a 
shell, defined by /bin/sh. In this case, the enclosing expression 
is (expr $(A) + $(B)) and is evaluated by Bash.

⇒ PATH is /bin/:/usr/bin                                 | Declare a variable and assign to it. However, the difference is 
that the = syntax does not allow refer to a variable to use 
itself as a value in the right hand side, while this syntax does.

| PATH = /bin

PATH += /usr/bin


⇒ PATH is /bin/:/usr/bin                                       | Append a new value at the end of a variable. Equivalent to: 

PATH := $PATH:/usr/bin
                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| CFLAGS ?= -o


⇒ CFLAGS is assigned the value -o if it was not defined.                        | This syntax is called conditional reference. Set a variable to a 
value if it is undefined. This is useful if a user wants to 
supply different value for a variable from the command line e.g. 
add debugging option to CFLAGS. Otherwise, Make uses the default 
defined by ?=.

| SRCS = lib1.c lib2.c main.c

OBJS := $(SRC:.o=.c)


⇒ OBJS has the value lib1.o lib2.o main.o  | This syntax is called substitution reference. A part of 
referenced variable is replaced with something else. In this 
case, all the .c extension is replaced by .o extension, thus 
creating a list of object files for OBJS variable from the list 
of source files from SRCS variable.
 |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Code in GNU Make is a collection of recipes that it can run. Each 
recipe is analogous to a function in a programming language, and 
can be called like a regular function. Each recipe carries a 
series of shell commands to be executed by a shell e.g. Bash. A 
recipe has the following format:

target: prerequisites

	command

Each target is analogous to a function name. Each prerequisite is 
a call another target. Each command is one of Make's built-in 
commands or a command that is executable by a shell. All 
prerequisites must be satisfied before entering main body of target
; that is, each prerequisite must not return any error. If any 
error is returned, Make terminates the whole build process and 
prints an error on the command line.

Each time make runs, by default if no target is supplied, it 
starts with all target, go through every prerequisites and 
finally the body of all. all is analogous to main in other 
programming languages. However, if make is given a target, it 
will start from that target instead of main. This feature is 
useful to automate multiple aspects in a project. For example, 
one target is for building the project, one target is for 
generating the documents e.g. test reports, another target for 
running the whole test suite and all runs every main targets.



  Automate debugging steps with GDB script<sub:Automate-debugging-steps>

For the convenience, we save GDB configuration to .gdbinit file 
at the project root directory. This configuration is just a 
collection of GDB commands and a few extra commands. When gdb 
runs, it first loads the .gdbinit file at home directory, then 
the .gdbinit file at the current directory. Why shouldn't we put 
commands in ~/.gdbinit? Because these commands are specific to 
only this projec e.g. not all programs are required a remote 
connection.

Our first configuration:

define hook-stop

    # Translate the segment:offset into a physical address

    printf "[%4x:%4x] ", $cs, $eip

    x/i $cs*16+$eip

end

The above script displays the memory address in [segment:offset] 
format, which is necessary for debugging our bootloader and 
operating system code.

It is better to use Intel syntax:

set disassembly-flavor intel

The following commands set a more convenient layout for debugging 
assembly code:

layout asm

layout reg

We are currently debugging bootloader code, so it is a good idea 
to first set it to 16-bit:

set architecture i8086

Every time the QEMU virtual machine starts, gdb must always 
connect to port 26000. To avoid the trouble of manually 
connecting to the virtual machine, add the command:

target remote localhost:26000

Debugging the bootloader needs a breakpoint at 0x7c00, where our 
bootloader code starts:

b *0x7c00

Now, whenever gdb starts, it automatically set correct 
architecture based on code, automatically connects to the virtual 
machine[footnote:
The QEMU virtual machine should have already been started before 
starting gdb.
], displays output in a convenient layout and set a necessary 
breakpoint. All that need to do is run the program. 

Linking and loading on bare metal<chap:Linking-and-loading>

[margin:
Relocation
]RelocationRelocation is the process of replacing symbol 
references with its actual symbolic definitions in an object 
file. A symbol reference is the memory address of a symbol.

If the definition is hard to understand, consider a similar 
analogy: house relocation. Suppose that a programmer bought a new 
house and the new house is empty. He must buy furnitures and 
appliances to fulfill daily needs and thus, he made a list of 
items to buy, and where to place them. To visualize the 
placements of new items, he draws a blueprint of the house and 
the respective places of all items. He then travels to the shops 
to buy goods. Whenever he visit a shop and sees matched items, he 
tells the shop owner to note them down. After done selecting, he 
tells the shop owner to pick up a brand new item instead of the 
objects on display, then give the address for delivering the 
goods to his new house. Finally, when the goods arrive, he places 
the items where he planned at the beginning.



Now that house relocation is clear, object relocation is similar:

• The list of items represents the relocation table, where the 
  memory location for each symbol (item) is predetermined.

• Each item represents a pair of symbol definition and its symbol 
  address.

• Each shop represents a compiled object file.

• Each item on display represents a symbol definition and 
  references in the object file.

• The new address, where all the goods are delivered, represents 
  the final executable binary or the final object file. Since the 
  items on display are not for sale, the shop owner delivers 
  brand new goods instead. Similarly, the object files are not 
  merged together, but copied all over a new file, the 
  object/executable file.

• Finally, the goods are placed in the positions according to the 
  shopping list made from the beginning. Similarly, the symbol 
  definitions are placed appropriately in its respective section 
  and the symbol references of the final object/executable file 
  are replaced with the actual memory addresses of the symbol 
  definitions.





  Understand relocations with readelf<sec:Understand-relocations-with-readelf>

Earlier, when we explore object sections, there exists sections 
that begins with .rel. These sections are relocation tables that 
maps between a symbol and its location in the final object file 
or the final executable binary[footnote:
A .rel section is equivalent to a list of items in the house 
analogy.
]. 

Suppose that a function foo is defined in another object file, so 
main.c declares it as extern:

int i;

void foo();

int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    i = 5;

    foo();

    return 0;

}



void foo() {}

When we compile main.c as object file with this command:



$ gcc -m32 -masm=intel -c main.c



Then, we can inspect the relocation tables with this command:



$ readelf -r main.o



The output:



Relocation section '.rel.text' at offset 0x1cc contains 2 
entries:

 Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name

0000001c  00000a02 R_386_PC32        0000002e   foo

Relocation section '.rel.eh_frame' at offset 0x1dc contains 2 
entries:

  Offset 

An [margin:
offset
]offsetoffset is the location into a section of a binary file, 
where the actual memory address of a symbol definition is 
replaced. The section with .rel prefix determines which section 
to offset into. For example, .rel.text is the relocation table of 
symbols whose address needs correcting in .text section, at a 
specific offset into .text section. In the example output:



0000001c  00000a02 R_386_PC32        0000002e   foo



The blue number indicates there exists a reference of symbol foo 
that is 1c bytes into .text section. To see it clearer, we 
recompile main.c with option -g into the file main_debug.o, then 
run objdump on it and got:



Disassembly of section .text:

00000000 <main>:

The byte at 1b[superscript:] is the opcode e8, the call instruction; byte at 1c is the value 
fc. Why is the operand value for e8 is 0xfffffffc, which is 
equivalent to -4, but the translated instruction call 1c?

  Info 

Info specifies index of a symbol in the symbol table and the type 
of relocation to perform. 



0000001c  00000a02 R_386_PC32        0000002e   foo



The pink number is the index of symbol foo in the symbol table, 
and the green number is the relocation type. The numbers are 
written in hex format. In the example, 0a means 10 in decimal, 
and symbol foo is indeed at index 10:



10: 0000002e     6 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    1 foo



  Type 

Type represents the type value in textual form. Looking at the 
type of foo:



0000001c  00000a02 R_386_PC32        0000002e   foo



The green number is type in its numeric form, and R_386_PC32 is 
the name assigned to that value. Each value represents a 
relocation method of calculation. For example, with the type 
R_386_PC32, the following formula is applied for relocation 
(Inteli386 psABI): 

Relocated\,Offset=S+A-P


To understand the formula, it is necessary to understand symbol 
values.

  Sym.Value 

This field shows the symbol value. A symbol value is a value 
assigned to a symbol, whose meaning depends on the Ndx field:

  A symbol whose section index is COMMON, its symbol value holds 
  alignment constraints.

  In the symbol table, the variable i is identified as COM 
  (uninitialized variable):[footnote:
The command for listing symbol table is (assume the object file 
is hello.o):

readelf -s hello.o
]

    

    Symbol table '.symtab' contains 16 entries:

       Num:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name

         0: 00000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND

    so its symbol value is a memory alignment for assigning a 
    proper memory address that conforms to the alignment in the 
    final memory address. In the case of i, the value is 4, so 
    the starting memory address of i in the final binary file 
    will be a multiple of 4.

  A symbol whose Ndx identifies a specific section, its symbol 
  value holds a section offset.

  In the symbol table, main and foo belong to section 1:

    

    14: 00000000    46 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    1 main

    15: 0000002e     6 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    1 foo

The command for listing sections is (assume the object file is

  In the final executable and shared object files, instead of the

    Unlike the values of the symbols foo, i and main as in the 
    hello.o object file, the complete memory addresses are in 
    place.

Now it suffices to understand relocation types. Previously, we 
mentioned the type R_386_PC32. The following formula is applied 
for relocation (Inteli386 psABI): 

Relocated\,Offset=S+A-P


where

  S represents the value of the symbol. In the final executable 
  binary, it is the address of the symbol.

  A represents the addend, an extra value added to the value of a 
  symbol.

  P Represents the memory address to be fixed.

  Relocate Offset is the distance between a relocating location[footnote:
where the referenced memory address is to be fixed.
] and the actual memory location of a symbol definition, or a 
  memory address.

But why do we waste time in calculating a distance instead of 
replacing with a direct memory address? The reason is that x86 
architecture does not use employ any addressing mode that uses an 
absolute memory address, as listed in table [mod-rm-32]. All 
addressing modes in x86 are relative. In some assembly language, 
an absolute address can be used simply because it is a syntactic 
sugar that is later transformed into one of the relative 
addressing mode provided by the x86 hardware by the assembler.


-------------------------------------------


For the foo symbol:

  

  0000001c  00000a02 R_386_PC32        0000002e   foo

  

  The distance between the usage of foo in main.o and its 
  definition, applying the formula S+A-P
 is: \mathtt{2e+0-1c=12}

  . That is, the place where memory fixing starts is 0x12 or 18 
  bytes away from the definition of the symbol foo. However, to 
  make an instruction works properly, we must also subtract 4 
  from 0x12 and results in 0xe. Why the extra -4? Because the 
  relative address starts at the end of an instruction, not the 
  address where memory fixing starts. For that reason, we must 
  also exclude the 4 bytes of the overwritten address. 

  Indeed, looking at the objdump output of the object file 
  hello.o:

  

  Disassembly of section .text:

  00000000 <main>:

     0:   8d 4c 24 04             lea    ecx,[esp+0x4]

    33:   c3                      ret    

  

  The place where memory fixing starts is after the opcode e8, 
  with the mock value fc ff ff ff, which is -4 in decimal. 
  However, the assembly code, the value is displayed as 1c. the 
  memory address right after e8. The reason is that the 
  instruction e8 starts at 1b and ends at 20[footnote:
The end of an instruction is the memory address right after its 
last operand. The whole instruction e8 spans from the address 1b 
to the address 1f. 
]. -4 means 4 bytes backward from the end of instruction, that 
  is: \mathtt{20-4=1c}
. After linking, the output of the final 
  executable file is displayed with the actual memory fixing:

  

  080483db <main>:

   80483db:       8d 4c 24 04             lea    ecx,[esp+0x4]

   8048400:       83 c4 04                add    esp,0x4

   8048403:       59                      pop    ecx

   8048404:       5d                      pop    ebp

   8048405:       8d 61 fc                lea    esp,[ecx-0x4]

   8048408:       c3                      ret 

  

  08048409 <foo>:

   8048409:       55                      push   ebp

   804840a:       89 e5                   mov    ebp,esp

   804840c:       90                      nop

   804840d:       5d                      pop    ebp

   804840e:       c3                      ret    

   804840f:       90                      nop

  

  In the final output, the opcode e8 previously at 1b now starts 
  at the address 80483f6. The mock value fc ff ff ff is replaced 
  with the actual value 0e 00 00 00 using the same calculating 
  method from its object file: opcode e8 is at 80483f6. The 
  definition of foo is at 8048409. The offset from the next 
  address after e8 is \mathtt{8048409+0-80483f7-4=0e}
. However, 
  for readability, the assembly is displayed as call 8048409 
  <foo>, since GNU as[footnote:
Or any current assembler in use today.
] assembler allows specifying the actual memory address of a 
  symbol definition. Such address is later translated into 
  relative addressing mode, saving the programmer the trouble of 
  calculating offset manually.

  Sym. Name

This field displays the name of a symbol to be relocated. The 
named symbol is the same as written in a high level language such 
as C.

  Crafting ELF binary with linker scripts

A [margin:
linker
]linkerlinker is a program that combines separated object files 
into a final binary file. When gcc is invoked, it runs ld 
underneath to turn object files into the final executable file..

A linker script[margin:
linker script
]linker script is a text file that instructs how a linker should 
combine object files. When gcc runs, it uses its default linker 
script to build the memory layout of a compiled binary file. 
Standardized memory layout is called object file format e.g. ELF 
includes program headers, section headers and their attributes. 
The default linker script is made for running in the current 
operating system environment[footnote:
To view the default script, use --verbose option:

ld --verbose
]. Running on bare metal, the default script cannot be used as it 
is not designed for such environment. For that reason, a 
programmer needs to supply his own linker script for such 
environments.

Every linker script consists of a series of commands with the 
following format:

COMMAND 

{

  sub-command 1

  sub-command 2

  .... more sub-command....

}

Each sub-command is specific to only the top-level command. The 
simplest linker script needs only one command: SECTION, that 
consumes input sections from object files and produces output 
sections of the final binary file[footnote:
Recall that sections are chunks of code or data, or both.
]. 

  Example linker script

Here is a minimal example of a linker script:

SECTIONS                      /* Command */

{

   . = 0x10000;               /* sub-command 1 */

   .text : { *(.text) }       /* sub-command 2 */

   . = 0x8000000;             /* sub-command 3 */

   .data : { *(.data) }       /* sub-command 4 */

   .bss : { *(.bss) }         /* sub-command 5 */

}

| SECTION                | Top-level command that declares a list of custom program 
sections. ld provides a set of such commands.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| . = 0x10000;           | Set location counter to the address 0x10000. Location counter 
specifies the base address for subsequent commands. In this 
example, subsequent commands will use 0x10000 onward.                                                                                                              |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .text : { *(.text) }   | Since location counter is set to 0x10000, the output .text in the 
final binary file will starts at the address 0x10000. This 
command combines all .text sections from all object files with 
*(.text) syntax into a final .text section. The * is the wildcard 
which matches any file name. |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| . = 0x8000000;         | Again, the location counter is set to 0x8000000. Subsequent 
commands will use this address for working with sections.                                                                                                                                                                         |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .data : { *(.data) }   | All .data section are combined into one .data section in the 
final binary file.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .bss : { *(.bss) }     | All .bss section are combined into one .bss section in the final 
binary file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The addresses 0x10000 and 0x8000000 are called Virtual Memory 
Address. A virtual memory address[margin:
virtual memory address
]virtual memory address is the address where a section is loaded 
in memory when a program runs. To use the linker script, we save 
it as a file e.g. main.lds[footnote:
.lds is the extension for linker script.
]; then, we need a sample program in a file, e.g. main.c: 

void test() {}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

  

    return 0;

}

Then, we compile the file and explicitly invoke ld with the 
linker script:



$ gcc -m32 -g -c main.c

$ ld -m elf_i386 -o main -T main.lds main.o



In the ld command, the options are similar to gcc:


+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Option  | Description                                                                                                  |
+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -m      | Specify object file format that ld produces. In the example, 
elf_i386 means a 32-bit ELF is to be produced. |
+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -o      | Specify the name of the final executable binary.                                                             |
+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -T      | Specify the linker script to use. In the example, it is main.lds.                                            |
+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


The remaining input is a list of object files for linking. After 
the command ld is executed, the final executable binary - main - 
is produced. If we try running it:



$ ./main

Segmentation fault 



The reason is that when linking manually, the entry address must 
be explicitly set, or else ld sets it to the start of .text 
section by default. We can verify from the readelf output:



$ readelf -h main

The entry point address is set to 0x10000, which is the beginning 
of .text section. Using objdump to examine the address:



$ objdump -z -M intel -S -D prog | less



we see that the address 0x10000 does not start at main function 
when the program runs:



Disassembly of section .text:

00010000 <test>:

int a = 5;

int i;

void test(){}

   10000:       55                      push   ebp

{

   10006:       55                      push   ebp

   10007:       89 e5                   mov    ebp,esp

    

    return 0;

The start of .text section at 0x10000 is the function test, not 
main! To enable the program to run at main properly, we need to 
set the entry point in the linker script with the following line 
at the beginning of the file:

ENTRY(main)

Recompile the executable binary file main again. This time, the 
output from readelf is different:

The program now executes code at the address 0x10006 when it 
starts. 0x10006 is where main starts! To make sure we really 
starts at main, we run the program with gdb, set two breakpoints 
at main and test functions:



$ gdb ./main





.... output omitted ....

Reading symbols from ./main...done.





(gdb) b test





Breakpoint 1 at 0x10003: file main.c, line 1.





(gdb) b main





Breakpoint 2 at 0x10009: file main.c, line 5.





(gdb) r





Starting program: /tmp/main 

Breakpoint 2, main (argc=-11493, argv=0x0) at main.c:5

5	    return 0;



As displayed in the output, gdb stopped at the 2[superscript:nd] breakpoint first. Now, we run the program normally, without gdb: 



$ ./main

Segmentation fault 



We still get a segmentation fault. It is to be expected, as we 
ran a custom binary without C runtime support from the operating 
system. The last statement in the main function: return 0, simply 
returns to a random place[footnote:
Return address is above the current ebp. However, when we enter 
main, no return value is pushed on the stack. So, when return is 
executed, it simply retrieves any value above ebp and use as a 
return address.
]. The C runtime ensures that the program exit properly. In 
Linux, the _exit() function is implicitly called when main 
returns. To fix this problem, we simply change the program to 
exit properly:

void test() {}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    asm("mov eax, 0x1\n"

        "mov ebx, 0x0\n"

        "int 0x80");

}

Inline assembly is required because interrupt 0x80 is defined for 
system calls in Linux. Since the program uses no library, there 
is no other way to call system functions, aside from using 
assembly. However, when writing our operating system, we will not 
need such code, as there is no environment for exiting properly 
yet.

Now that we can precisely control where the program runs 
initially, it is easy to bootstrap the kernel from the 
bootloader. Before we move on to the next section, note how 
readelf and objdump can be applied to debug a program even before 
it runs.

  Understand the custom ELF structure

In the example, we manage to create a runnable ELF executable 
binary from a custom linker script, as opposed to the default one 
provided by gcc. To make it convenient to look into its 
structure:



$ readelf -e main



-e option is the combination of 3 options -h -l -S: 



....... ELF header output omitted .......

 Section to Segment mapping:

  Segment Sections...

   00     .text .eh_frame 

   01     



The structure is incredibly simple. Both the segment and section 
listings can be contained within one screen. This is not the case 
with default ELF executable binary. From the output, there are 
only 11 sections, and only two are loaded at runtime: .text and 
.eh_frame because both section are assigned with an actual memroy 
addresses, 0x10000 and 0x10010 respectively. The remaining 
sections are assigned with 0 in the final executable binary[footnote:
As opposed to the object files, where memory addresses are always 
0 and only assigned with actual values in the linking process.
], which mean they are not loaded at runtime. It makes sense, as 
those sections are related to versioning[footnote:
It is the .comment section. It can be viewed with the comment 
readelf -p .comment main.
], debugging[footnote:
The ones starts with .debug prefix.
] and linking[footnote:
The symbol tables and string table.
].

The program segment header table is even simpler. It only 
contains 2 segments: LOAD and GNU_STACK. By default, if the 
linker script does not supply the instructions for building 
program segments, ld provides reasonable default segments. As in 
this case, .text should be in the LOAD segment. GNU_STACK segment 
is a GNU extension used by the Linux kernel to control the state 
of the program stack. We will not need this segment, along with 
.eh_frame, which is for exception handling, as we write our own 
operating system from scratch. To achieve these goals, we will 
need to create our own program headers instead of letting ld 
handles the task, and instruct ld to remove .eh_frame.

  Manipulate the program segments

First, we need to craft our own program header table by using the 
following syntax:

PHDRS

{

  <name> <type> [ FILEHDR ] [ PHDRS ] [ AT ( address ) ]

        [ FLAGS ( flags ) ] ;

}

PHDRS command, similar to SECTION command, but for declaring a 
list of custom program segments with a predefined syntax. 

  name is the header name for later referenced by a section 
  declared in SECTION command.

  type is the ELF segment type, as described in section [sec:Program-header-table]
  , with added prefix PT_. For example, instead of NULL or LOAD 
  as displayed by readelf, it is PT_NULL or PT_LOAD.


-------------------------------------------


With only name and type, we can create any number of program 
segments. For example, we can add the NULL program segment and 
remove the GNU_STACK segment:

  PHDRS

{

    null PT_NULL;

    code PT_LOAD;

}



SECTIONS

{

    . = 0x10000;

    .text : { *(.text) } :code

    . = 0x8000000;

    .data : { *(.data) }

    .bss : { *(.bss) }

}

  The content of PHDRS command tells that the final executable 
  binary contains 2 program segments: NULL and LOAD. The NULL 
  segment is given the name null and LOAD segment given the name 
  code to signify this LOAD segment contains program code. Then, 
  to put a section into a segment, we use the syntax :<phdr>, 
  where phdr is the name given to a segment earlier. In this 
  example, .text section is put into code segment. We compile and 
  see the result (assuming main.o compiled earlier remains):

  

  $ ld -m elf_i386 -o main -T main.lds main.o

  $ readelf -l main

  

  

  Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)

  Entry point 0x10000

  There are 2 program headers, starting at offset 52

  Program Headers:

We can add as many segments of the same type, as long as they are

  After amending the PHDRS content earlier with this new segment 
  listing, we put .text into code1 segment and .eh_frame into

  FILEHDR is an optional keyword, when added specifies that a 
  program segment includes the ELF file header of the executable 
  binary. However, this attribute should only added for the first 
  program segment, as it drastically alters the size and starting 
  address of a segment because the ELF header is always at the 
  beginning of a binary file, recall that a segment starts at the 
  address of its first content, which is in most of the cases 
  (except for this case, which is the file header), the first 
  section.


-------------------------------------------


Adding the FILEHDR keyword changes the size of NULL segment:

  PHDRS

{

    null PT_NULL FILEHDR;

    code PT_LOAD;

}

..... content is the same .....

  We link it again and see the result:

  

  $ ld -m elf_i386 -o main -T main.lds main.o

  $ readelf -l main

  In previous examples, the file size and memory size of the NULL 
  section are always 0, now they are both 34 bytes, which is the 
  size of an ELF header.



If we assign FILEHDR to a non-starting segment, its size and 
starting address changes significantly:

  PHDRS

{

    null PT_NULL;

    code PT_LOAD FILEHDR;

}

    Segment Sections...

     01     .text .eh_frame 

  

  The size of the LOAD segment in the previous example is only 
  0x68, the same size as the total sizes of .text and .eh_frame 
  sections in it. But now, it is 0x01068, got 0x1000 bytes 
  larger. What is the reason for these extra bytes? A simple 
  answer: segment alignment. From the output, the alignment of 
  this segment is 0x1000; it means that regardless of which 
  address is the start of this segment, it must be divisible by 
  0x1000. For that reason, the starting address of LOAD is 0xf000 
  because it is divisible by 0x1000.

  Another question arises: why is the starting address 0xf000 
  instead of 0x10000? .text is the first section, which starts at 
  0x10000, so the segment should start at 0x10000. The reason is 
  that we include FILEHDR as part of the segment, it must expand 
  to include the ELF file header, which is at the very start of 
  an ELF executable binary. To satisfy this constraint and the 
  alignment constraint, 0xf000 is the closest address. Note that 
  the virtual and physical memory addresses are the addresses at 
  runtime, not the locations of the segment in the file on disk. 
  As the FileSiz field shows, the segment only consumes 0x1068 
  bytes on disk. Figure [LOAD_segment] illustrates the difference 
  between the memory layouts with and without FILEHDR keyword.

  PHDRS is an optional keyword, when added specifies that a 
  program segment is a program segment header table.


-------------------------------------------


The first segment of the default executable binary generated by 
gcc is a PHDR since the program segment header table appears 
right after the ELF header. It is also a convenient segment to 
put the ELF header into using the FILEHDR keyword. We replace the 
unused NULL segment earlier with a PHDR segment:

  PHDRS

{

    headers PT_PHDR FILEHDR PHDRS;

    code PT_LOAD FILEHDR;

}

..... content is the same .....

-------------------------------------------


  AT ( address ) specifies the load memory address where the 
  segment is placed. Every segment or section has a virtual 
  memory address and a load memory address:

  • A [margin:
virtual memory address
]virtual memory addressvirtual memory address is a starting 
    address of a segment or a section when a program is in memory 
    and running. The memory address is called virtual because it 
    does not map to the actual memory cell that corresponds to 
    the address number, but any random memory cell, which depends 
    on how the underlying operating system translates the 
    address. For example, the virtual memory address 0x1 might 
    map to the memory cell with the physical address 0x1000.

  • A load memory address[margin:
load memory address
]load memory address is the physical memory address, where a 
    program is loaded but not yet running.

  The load memory address is specified by AT syntax. Normally 
  both types of addresses are the same, and the physical address 
  can be ignored. They differ when loading and running are 
  purposely divided into two distinct phases that require 
  different address regions. 

  For example, a program can be designed to load into a ROM[footnote:
Read-Only Memory
] at a fixed address. But when loading into RAM for a bare-metal 
  application or an operating system to use, the program needs a 
  load address that accommodates the addressing scheme of the 
  target application or operating system. 


-------------------------------------------


We can specify a load memory address for the segment LOAD with AT 
syntax:

  PHDRS

{

    headers PT_PHDR FILEHDR PHDRS AT(0x500);

    code PT_LOAD;

}

..... content is the same .....

     01     .text .eh_frame 

  

  It depends on an operating system whether to use the address or 
  not. For our operating system, the virtual memory address and 
  load are the same, so an explicit load address is none of our 
  concern.


-------------------------------------------


  FLAGS (flags) assigns permissions to a segment. Each flag is an 
  integer that represents a permission and can be combined with 
  OR operations. Possible values:

  
+-------------+--------+-------------+
  | Permission  | Value  | Description |
  +-------------+--------+-------------+
  +-------------+--------+-------------+
  | R           | 1      | Readable    |

We can create a LOAD segment with Read, Write and Execute 
permissions enabled:

    code PT_LOAD FILEHDR FLAGS(0x1 | 0x2 | 0x4);

  LOAD segment now gets all the RWE permissions, as shown above.


-------------------------------------------


Finally, we want to remove the .eh_frame or any unwanted section, 
we add a special section called /DISCARD/:

... program segment header table remains the same ...

{

    /* . = 0x10000; */

    .text : { *(.text) } :code

    .bss : { *(.bss) }

    /DISCARD/ : { *(.eh_frame) }

}

Any section putting in /DISCARD/ disappears in the final 
executable binary:



$ ld -m elf_i386 -o main -T main.lds main.o

$ readelf -l main

  C Runtime: Hosted vs Freestanding<sec:C-Runtime>

The purpose of .init, .init_array, .fini_array and .preinit_array 
section is to initialize a C Runtime environment that supports 
the C standard libraries. Why does C need a runtime environment, 
when it is supposed to be a compiled language? The reason is that 
many of the standard functions depend on the underlying operating 
system, which is of itself a big runtime environment. For 
example, I/O related functions such as reading from keyboard with 
gets(), reading from file with open(), printing on screen with 
printf(), managing system memory with malloc(), free(), etc. 

A C implementation cannot provide such routines without a running 
operating system, which is a hosted environment. A hosted environment
hosted environment is a runtime environment that:

• provides a default implementation of C libraries that includes 
  system-dependent data and routines.

• perform resource allocations to prepare an environment for a 
  program to run. 

This process is similar to the hardware initialization process:

• When first powered up, a desktop computer loads its basic 
  system routines from a read-only memory stored on the 
  motherboard.

• Then, it starts initializing an environment, such as setting 
  default values for various registers in CPU and devices, before 
  executing the any code. 

In contrast, a freestanding environmentfreestanding environment 
is an environment that does not provide system-dependent data and 
routines. As a consequence, almost no C library exists and the 
environment can run code compiled written from pure C syntax. For 
a free standing environment to become a host environment, it must 
implement standard C system routines. But for a conforming 
freestanding environment, it only needs these header files 
available: <float.h>, <limits.h>, <stadarg.h> and <stddef.h> 
(according to GCC manual).

For a typical desktop x86 program, C runtime environment is 
initialized by a compiler so a program runs normal. However, for 
an embedded platform where a program runs directly on it, this is 
not the case. The typical C runtime environment used in desktop 
operating systems cannot be used on the embedded platforms, 
because architectural differences and resource constraints. As 
such, the software writer must implement a custom C runtime 
environment suitable for the targeted platform. For the embedded 
platform, 

In writing our operating system, the first step is to create a 
freestanding environment before creating a hosted one.

  Debuggable bootloader on bare metal

Currently, the bootloader is compiled as a flat binary file. 
Although gdb can display the assembly code, it is not always the 
same as the source code. In the assembly source code, there 
exists variable names and labels. These symbols are lost when 
compiled as a flat binary file, making debugging more difficult. 
Another issue is the mismatch between the written assembly source 
code and the displayed assembly source code. The written code 
might contain higher level syntax that is assembler-specific and 
is generated into lower-level assembly code as displayed by gdb. 
Finally, with debug information available, the command next/n and 
prev/p can be used instead of ni and si.

To enable debug information, we modify the bootloader Makefile:

1. The bootloader must be compiled as a ELF binary. Open the 
  Makefile in bootloader/ directory and change this line under 
  $(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: %.asm recipe:

  nasm -f bin $< -o $@

  to this line:

  nasm -f elf $< -F dwarf -g -o $@

  In the updated recipe, bin format is replaced with elf format 
  to enable debugging information to be properly produced.-F 
  option specifies the debug information format, which is dwarf 
  in this case. Finally, -g option causes nasm to actually 
  generate debug information in selected format.

2. Then, ld consumes the ELF bootloader binary and produces 
  another ELF bootloader binary, with proper starting memory 
  address of .text section that match the actual address of the 
  bootloader at runtime, when QEMU virtual machine loads it at 
  0x7c00. We need ld because when compiled by nasm, the starting 
  address is assumed to be 0, not 0x7c00.

3. Finally, we use objcopy to separate extract only the flat 
  binary content as the original bootloader by adding this line 
  to $(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: %.asm:

  objcopy -O binary $(BUILD_DIR)/bootloader.o.elf $@

  objcopy, as its name implies, is a program that copies and 
  translates object files. Here, we copy the original ELF 
  bootloader and translate it into a flat binary file.

The updated recipe should look like:

$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: %.asm

	nasm -f elf $< -F dwarf -g -o $@

	ld -m elf_i386 -T bootloader.lds $@ -o $@.elf

	objcopy -O binary  $(BUILD_DIR)/bootloader.o.elf $@

Now we test the bootloader with debug information available:

1. Start the QEMU machine:

  

  $ make qemu

  

2. Start gdb with the debug information stored in 
  bootloader.o.elf:

  

  $ gdb build/bootloader/bootloader.o.elf

  

  After getting into gdb, press the Enter key and if the sample 
  .gdbinit section [sub:Automate-debugging-steps] is used, the 
  output should look like:

  

  ---Type <return> to continue, or q <return> to quit---

  [f000:fff0] 0x0000fff0 in ?? ()

  Breakpoint 1 at 0x7c00: file bootloader.asm, line 6.

  (gdb)

  

  gdb now understand where the instruction at address 0x7c00 is 
  in the assembly source file, thanks to the debug information.

  Debuggable program on bare metal

The process of building a debug-ready executable binary is 
similar to that of a bootloader, except more involved. Recall 
that for a debugger to work properly, its debugging information 
must contain correct address mappings between memory addresses 
and the source code. gcc stores such mapping information in DIE 
entries, in which it tells gdb at which code address corresponds 
to a line in a source file, so that breakpoints work properly.

But first, we need a sample C source file, a very simple one:

void main() {}

Because this is a free standing environment, standard libraries 
that involve system functions such as printf() would not work, 
because a C runtime does not exist. At this stage, the goal is to 
correctly jump to main with source code displayed properly in 
gdb, so no fancy C code is needed yet.

The next step is updating os/Makefile:

BUILD_DIR=../build_os

OS=$(BUILD_DIR)/os



@|\color{red}\bfseries CFLAGS+=-ffreestanding -nostdlib -gdwarf-4 
-m32 -ggdb3|@



OS_SRCS := $(wildcard *.c)

OS_OBJS := $(patsubst %.c, $(BUILD_DIR)/%.o, $(OS_SRCS))



all: $(OS)



$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: %.c

	gcc $(CFLAGS) -m32 -c  $< -o $@



$(OS): $(OS_OBJS)

	ld -m elf_i386 -T@|\color{blue}\bfseries os.lds|@ $(OS_OBJS) -o

clean:

	rm $(OS_OBJS)

We updated the Makefile with the following changes:

• Add a CFLAGS variable for passing options to gcc.

• Instead of the rule to build assembly source code earlier, it 
  is replaced with a C version with a recipe to build C source 
  files. The CFLAGS variable makes the gcc command in the recipe 
  looks cleaner regardless how many options are added.

• Add a linking command for building the final executable binary 
  of the operating system with a custom linker script os.lds.

Everything looks good, except for the linker script part. Why is 
it needed? The linker script is required for controlling at which 
physical memory address the operating system binary appears in 
the memory, so the linker can jump to the operating system code 
and execute it. To complete this requirement, the default linker 
script used by gcc would not work as it assumes the compiled 
executable runs inside an existing operating system, while we are 
writing an operating system itself.

The next question is, what will be the content in the linker 
script? To answer this question, we must understand what goals to 
achieve with the linker script:

• For the bootloader to correctly jump to and execute the 
  operating system code.

• For gdb to debug correctly with the operating system source 
  code.

To achieve the goals, we must devise a design of a suitable 
memory layout for the operating system. Recall that the 
bootloader developed in chapter [chap:Bootloader] can already 
load a simple binary compiled from the sample Assembly program 
sample.asm. To load the operating system, we can simply throw 
binary compiled from sample.asm with the binary compiled from 
os.c above.

If only it is that simple. The idea is correctly, but not enough. 
The goals implies the following constraints:

1. The operating system code is written in C and compiled as an 
  ELF executable binary. It means, the bootloader needs to 
  retrieve correct entry address from the ELF header.

2. To debug properly with gdb, the debug info must contain 
  correct mappings between instruction addresses and source code.

Thanks to the understanding of ELF and DWARF acquire in the 
earlier chapters, we can certainly modify the bootloader and 
create an executable binary that satisfy the above constraint. We 
will solve these problems one by one.

  Loading an ELF binary from a bootloader

Earlier we examined that an ELF header contains a entry address 
of a program. That information is 0x18 bytes away from the 
beginning of an ELF header, according to man elf :

typedef struct {

               unsigned char e_ident[EI_NIDENT];

               uint16_t      e_type;

               uint16_t      e_machine;

               uint32_t      e_version;

               ElfN_Addr     e_entry;

               ElfN_Off      e_phoff;

               ElfN_Off      e_shoff;

               uint32_t      e_flags;

               uint16_t      e_ehsize;

               uint16_t      e_phentsize;

               uint16_t      e_phnum;

               uint16_t      e_shentsize;

               uint16_t      e_shnum;

               uint16_t      e_shstrndx;

           } ElfN_Ehdr;

The offset from the start of the struct to the start of e_entry 
is:

• 16 bytes of e_ident[EI_NIDENT]:

  #define EI_NIDENT 16

• 2 bytes of e_type

• 2 bytes of e_machine

• 4 bytes of e_version

\mathtt{Offset=16+2+2+4=24=0x18}


e_entry is of type ElfN_Addr, in which N is either 32 or 64. We 
are writing 32-bit operating system, in this case N=32
 and so 
ElfN_Addr is Elf32_Addr, which is 4 bytes long.

With any program, such as this simple one:

  #include <stdio.h>



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("hello world!\n");

    return 0;

}

  We can retrieve the entry address with a human-readable 
  presentation using readelf:

  

  $ gcc hello.c -o hello

  $ readelf -h hello

  

  

  ELF Header:

    Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 

    .... output omitted ....

    Entry point address:               0x400430

    .... output omitted ....

  

  Or in raw binary with hd:

  

  $ hd hello | less

  

  

  00000000  7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  
  |.ELF............|

  00000010  02 00 3e 00 01 00 00 00  30 04 40 00 00 00 00 00  
  |..>.....0.@.....|

  .........

  

  The offset 0x18 is the start of the least-significant byte of 
  e_entry, which is 0x30, followed by 04 40 00, together in 
  reverse makes the address 0x00400430.

Now that we know where the position of the entry address in the 
ELF header, it is easy to modify the bootloader made in section [sub:Read-and-load]
 to retrieve and jump to the address:

;******************************************

; Bootloader.asm

; A Simple Bootloader

;******************************************

bits 16

;; constant and variable definitions

boot:

  cli	; no interrupts

  cld	; all that we need to init



  mov		ax, 50h



  ;; set the buffer

  mov	al, 2					      ; read 2 sector

  mov	ch, 0                          ; we are reading the second 
sector past us,

                                        ; so its still on track 0

  mov	cl, 2					      ; sector to read (The second sector)

  mov	dh, 0					      ; head number

  mov	dl, 0					      ; drive number. Remember Drive 0 is floppy 
drive.



  mov	ah, 0x02			           ; read floppy sector function

  int	0x13					       ; call BIOS - Read the sector

  jmp	@|\color{blue}\bfseries [500h + 18h]|@				  ; jump and 
execute the sector!



  hlt	; halt the system



  ; We have to be 512 bytes. Clear the rest of the bytes with 0

  times 510 - ($-$$) db 0

  dw 0xAA55				  ; Boot Signiture

It is as simple as that! First, we load the operating system 
binary at 0x500, then we retrieve the entry address at the offset 
0x18 from 0x500, by first calculating the expression 500h+18h=518h

 to get the actual in-memory address, then retrieve the content 
by dereference it.

The first part is done. For the next part, we need to build an 
ELF operating system image for the bootloader to load. The first 
step is to create a linker script:

@|\color{blue}\bfseries ENTRY(main);|@



PHDRS

{

  headers PT_PHDR FILEHDR PHDRS;

  code PT_LOAD;

}



SECTIONS

{

  .text @|\color{blue}\bfseries 0x500|@: { *(.text)  } :code

  .data :  { *(.data)  }

  .bss :  { *(.bss) }

  /DISCARD/ : { *(.eh_frame) }

}

The script is straight-forward and remains almost the same as 
before. The only differences are:

• main are explicitly specified as the entry point by specifying 
  ENTRY(main).

• .text is explicitly specified with 0x500 as its virtual memory 
  address since we load the operating system image at 0x500.

After putting the script, we compile with make and it should work 
smoothly:



$ make clean; make

$ readelf -l  build/os/os 





Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)

Entry point 0x500

There are 2 program headers, starting at offset 52

Program Headers:

  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  
Flg Align

  PHDR           0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00074 0x00074 R 
  0x4

  LOAD           0x000500 0x00000500 0x00000500 0x00040 0x00040 R 
E 0x1000

 Section to Segment mapping:

  Segment Sections...

   00     

   01     .text



All looks good, until we run it. We begin by starting the QEMU 
virtual machine:



$ make qemu



Then, start gdb and load the debug info (which is also in the 
same binary file) and set a breakpoint at main:



(gdb) symbol-file build/os/os

Reading symbols from build/os/os...done.

(gdb) b main

Breakpoint 2 at 0x500



Then we start the program:



(gdb) symbol-file build/os/os

Reading symbols from build/os/os...done.

(gdb) b main

Breakpoint 2 at 0x500



Keep the programming running until it stops at main:



(gdb) c

Continuing.

[ 0:7c00] 

Breakpoint 1, 0x00007c00 in ?? ()

(gdb) c

Continuing.

[ 0: 500] 

Breakpoint 2, main () at main.c:1



At this point, we switch the layout to the C source code instead 
of the registers:



(gdb) layout split



layout split creates a layout that consists of 3 smaller windows: 

• Source window at the top.

• Assembly window in the middle.

• Command window at the bottom.

After the command, the layout should look like this:

Something wrong is going on here. It is not the generated 
assembly code for function call as it is known in section [sub:Function-Call-and]
. It is definitely wrong, verified with objdump:

The assembly code of main is completely different. This is why 
understanding assembly code and its relation to high-level 
languages are important. Without the knowledge, we would have 
used gdb as a simple source-level debugger without bother looking 
at the assembly code from the split layout. As a consequence, the 
true cause of the non-working code could never been discovered.

  Debugging the memory layout

What is the reason for the incorrect Assembly code in main 
displayed by gdb? There can only be one cause: the bootloader 
jumped to the wrong addresses. But why was the address wrong? We 
made the .text section at address 0x500, in which main code is in 
the first byte for executing, and instructed the bootloader to 
retrieve the address at the offset 0x18, then jump to the entry 
address.[float MarginFigure:
[MarginFigure 14:
Memory state after loading 2[superscript:nd] sector.
]<mem-state-bootloader>

     <Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/08/mem_after_load_os.pdf>
     
]

Then, it might be possible for the bootloader to load the 
operating system address at the wrong address. But then, we 
explicitly set the load address to 50h:00, which is 0x500, and so 
the correct address was used. After the bootloader loas the 2[superscript:nd] sector, the in-memory state should look like the figure [mem-state-bootloader]

the correct address was used. After the bootloader loads the 2[superscript:nd] sector, the in-memory state should look like the figure [mem-state-bootloader]
.

Here is the problem: 0x500 is the start of the ELF header. The 
bootloader actually loads the 2[superscript:nd] sector, which stores the executable as a whole, to 0x500. 
Clearly, .text section, where main resides, is far from 0x500. 
Since the in-memory entry address of the executable binary is 
0x500, .text should be at \mathtt{0x500+0x500=0xa00}
. However, 
the entry address recorded in the ELF header remains 0x500 and as 
a result, the bootloader jumped there instead of 0xa00. This is 
one of the issues that must be fixed.

The other issue is the mapping between debug info and the memory 
address. Because the debug info is compiled with the assumed 
offset 0x500 that is the start of .text section, but due to 
actual loading, the offset is pushed another 0x500 bytes, making 
the address actually is at 0xa00. This memory mismatch renders 
the debug info useless.

[float Figure:
[Figure 0.23:
Wrong symbol-memory mappings in debug info.
]

     <Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/08/debug_info_bad_position.pdf>
     
]

In summary, we have 2 problems to overcome:

• Fix the entry address to account for the extra offset when 
  loading into memory.

• Fix the debug info to account for the extra offset when loading 
  into memory.

First, we need to know the actual layout of the compiled 
executable binary:l



$ readelf -l build/os/os





Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)

Entry point 0x500

There are 2 program headers, starting at offset 52

Program Headers:

  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  
Flg Align

  PHDR           0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00074 0x00074 R 
  0x4

  LOAD           0x000500 0x00000500 0x00000500 0x00040 0x00040 R 
E 0x1000

 Section to Segment mapping:

  Segment Sections...

   00     

   01     .text



Notice the Offset and the VirtAddress fields: both have the same 
value. This is problematic, as the entry address and the memory 
addresses in the debug info depend on VirtAddr field, but the 
Offset having the same value destroys the validity of VirtAddr[footnote:
The offset is the distance in bytes between the beginning of the 
file, the address 0, to the beginning address of a segment or a 
section.
] because it means that the real in-memory address will always be 
greater than the VirtAddr. 

If we try to adjust the virtual memory address of the .text 
section in the linker script os.lds, whatever value we set also 
sets the Offset to the same value, until we set it to some value 
equal or greater than 0x1074:



Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)

Entry point 0x1074

There are 2 program headers, starting at offset 52

If we adjust the virtual address to 0x1073, both the Offset and 
VirtAddr still share the same value:



Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)

Entry point 0x1073

There are 2 program headers, starting at offset 52

The key to answer such phenonemon is in the Align field. The 
value 0x1000 indicates that the offset address of the segment 
should be divisible by 0x1000, or if the distance between segment 
is divisible by 0x1000, the linker removes such distance to save 
the binary size. We can do some experiments to verify this claim[footnote:
All the outputs are produced by the command:

$ readelf -l build/os/os
]:

• By setting the virtual address of .text to 0x0 to 0x73 (in 
  os.lds), the offset starts from 0x1000 to 0x1073, accordingly. 
  For example, by setting it to 0x0:

  

  Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)

  Entry point 0x0

  There are 2 program headers, starting at offset 52

  Program Headers:

    Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz

    PHDR           0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00074 0x00074 
  R   0x4

    LOAD           0x001000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00006 0x00006 
  R E 0x1000

   Section to Segment mapping:

    Segment Sections...

     00     

     01     .text 

  

  By default, if we do not specify any virtual address, the 
  offset stays at 0x1000 because 0x1000 is the perfect offset to 
  satisfy the alignment constraint. Any addition from 0x1 to 0x73 
  makes the segment misaligned, but the linker keeps it anyway 
  because it is told so.

• By setting the virtual address of .text to 0x74 (in os.lds):

  

  Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)

  Entry point 0x74

  There are 2 program headers, starting at offset 52

  Program Headers:

    Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz

  R   0x4

    LOAD           0x000074 0x00000074 0x00000074 0x00006 0x00006 
  R E 0x1000

   Section to Segment mapping:

    Segment Sections...

     00     

     01     .text 

  

  PHDR is 0x74 bytes in size, so if LOAD starts at 0x1074, the 
  distance between the PHDR segment and LOAD segment is \mathtt{0x1074-0x74=0x1000}

   bytes. To save space, it removes that extra 0x1000 bytes.

• By setting the virtual address of .text to any value between 
  0x75 and 0x1073 (in os.lds), the offset takes the exact values 
  specified, as can be seen in the case of setting to 0x1073 
  above.

• By setting the virtual address of .text to any value equal or 
  greater than 0x1074: it starts all over again at 0x74, where 
  the distance is equal to 0x1000 bytes.

Now we get a hint how to control the values of Offset and 
VirtAddr to produce a desired binary layout. What we need is to 
change the Align field to a value with smaller value for finer 
grain control. It might work out with a binary layout like this:



Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)

Entry point 0x600

There are 2 program headers, starting at offset 52

Program Headers:

  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz

  0x4

  LOAD           0x000100 0x00000600 0x00000600 0x00006 0x00006 R 
E 0x100

 Section to Segment mapping:

  Segment Sections...

   00     

   01     .text 





The binary will look like figure [fig-good-bin-layout] in memory:

[float Figure:

     <Graphics file: C:/Users/Tu Do/os01/book_src/images/08/binary_layout_good.pdf>
     
]

If we set the Offset field to 0x100 from the beginning of the 
file and the VirtAddr to 0x600, when loading in memory, the 
actual memory of .text is \mathtt{0x500+0x100=0x600}
; 0x500 is 
the memory location where the bootloader loads into the physical 
memory and 0x100 is the offset from the end of ELF header to 
.text. The entry address and the debug info will then take the 
value 0x600 from the VirtAddr field above, which totally matches 
the actual physical layout. We can do it by changing os.lds as 
follow:

@|\color{blue}\bfseries ENTRY(main);|@



PHDRS

{

  headers PT_PHDR FILEHDR PHDRS;

  code PT_LOAD;

}



SECTIONS

{

  .text @|\color{blue}\bfseries 0x600|@: @|\color{magenta} 
ALIGN(0x100)|@ { *(.text)  } :code

  .data :  { *(.data)  }

  .bss :  { *(.bss) }

  /DISCARD/ : { *(.eh_frame) }

}

The ALIGN keyword, as it implies, tells the linker to align a 
section, thus the segment containing it. However, to make the 
ALIGN keyword has any effect, automatic alignment must be 
disabled. According to man ld:



-n

--nmagic

    Turn off page alignment of sections, and disable linking 
against shared    

    libraries.  If the output format supports Unix style magic 
numbers, mark the 

    output as "NMAGIC"



That is, by default, each section is aligned by an operating 
system page, which is 4096, or 0x1000 bytes in size. The -n or 
-nmagic option disables this behavior, which is needed. We amend 
the ld command used in os/Makefile:

..... above content omitted ....

$(OS): $(OS_OBJS)

	ld -m elf_i386 @|\color{red}\bfseries -nmagic|@ -Tos.lds 
$(OS_OBJS) -o $@

Finally, we also need to update the top-level Makefile to write 
more than one sector into the disk image for the operating system 
binary, as its size exceeds one sector:



$ ls -l build/os/os

-rwxrwxr-x 1 tuhdo tuhdo 9060 Feb 13 21:37 build/os/os



We update the rule so that the sectors are automatically 
calculated:

..... above content omitted ....

bootdisk:  bootloader os

	dd if=/dev/zero of=$(DISK_IMG) bs=512 count=2880

	dd conv=notrunc if=$(BOOTLOADER) of=$(DISK_IMG) bs=512 count=1 
seek=0

	dd conv=notrunc if=$(OS) of=$(DISK_IMG) bs=512 count=$$(($(shell 
stat --printf="%s" $(OS))/512)) seek=1

After updating the everything, recompiling the executable binary 
and we get the desired offset and virtual memory at 0x100 and 
0x600, respectively:



Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)

Entry point 0x600

There are 2 program headers, starting at offset 52

Program Headers:

  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz

E 0x100

  Testing the new binary

First, we start the QEMU machine:



$ make qemu



In another terminal, we start gdb, loading the debug info and set 
a breakpoint at main:



$ gdb



The following output should be produced:



---Type <return> to continue, or q <return> to quit---

[f000:fff0] 0x0000fff0 in ?? ()

Breakpoint 1 at 0x7c00

Breakpoint 2 at 0x600: file main.c, line 1.





Then, let gdb runs until it hits the main function, then we 
change to the split layout between source and assembly:



(gdb) layout split



The final terminal output should look like this:

Now, the displayed assembly is the same as in objdump, except the 
registers are 16-bit ones. This is normal, as gdb is operating in 
16-bit mode, while objdump displays code in 32-bit mode. To make 
sure, we verify the raw opcode by using x command:



(gdb) x/16xb 0x600

such, the corresponding bytes from 0x600 to 0x605 are highlighted

Both raw opcode displayed by the two programs are the same. In 
this case, it proved that gdb correctly jumped to the address of 
main for a proper debugging. This is an extremely important 
milestone. Being able to debug in bare metal will help 
tremendously in writing an operating system, as a debugger allows 
a programmer to inspect the internal state of a running machine 
at each step to verify his code, step by step, to gradually build 
up a solid understanding. Some professional programmers do not 
like debuggers, but it is because they understand their domain 
deep enough to not need to rely on a debugger to verify their 
code. When encountering new domains, a debugger is indispensable 
learning tool because of its verifiability.

However, even with the aid of debugger, writing an operating 
system is still not a walk in the park. The debugger may give the 
access to the machine at one point in time, but it does not give 
the cause. To find out the root cause, is up to the ability of a 
programmer. Later in the book, we will learn how to use other 
debugging techniques, such as using QEMU logging facility to 
debug CPU exceptions.

Kernel Programming

x86 Descriptors

  Basic operating system concepts

The first and foremost, OS manages hardware resources. It's easy 
to see the core features of an OS based on Von Neumann diagram:

  CPU management: allows programs to share CPU for multitasking. 

  Memory management: allocates enough storage for programs to 
  run. 

  Devices management: detects and communicates with different 
  devices

Any OS should be good at the above fundamentals tasks. 

Another important feature of an OS is to provide an software 
interface layer, that hides away hardware interfaces, to 
interface with applications that run on top of that OS. The 
benefits of such a layer:

• reusability: that is, the same software API can be reused 
  across programs, thus simplifying software development process

• separation of concerns: bugs appear either in application 
  programs, or in the OS; a programmer needs to isolate where the 
  bugs are.

• simplify software development process: provides an easier to 
  use software interface layer with a uniform access to hardware 
  resources across devices, instead of directly using the 
  hardware interface of a particular device.

  Hardware Abstraction Layer

There are so many hardware devices out there, so it's best to 
leave the hardware engineers how the devices talk to an OS. To 
achieve this goal, the OS only provides a set of agreed software 
interfaces between itself and the device driver writers and is 
called Hardware Abstraction Layer.

In C, this software interface is implemented through a structure 
function pointers. 

[illustrate with Linux example]

  System programming interface 

System programming interfaces are standard interfaces that an OS 
provides application programs to use its services. For example, 
if a program wishes to read a file on disk, then it must call a 
function like open() and let the OS handle the details of talking 
to the hard disk for retrieving the file.

  The need for an Operating System 

In a way, OS is an overhead, but a necessary one, for a user to 
tell a computer what to do. When resources in a computer system 
(CPU, GPU, memory, hard drive...) became big and more 
complicated, it's tedious to manually manage all the resources.

Imagine we have to manually load programs on a computer with 3 GB 
of RAM. We would have to load programs at various fix addresses, 
and for each program a size must be manually calculated to avoid 
wasting memory resource, and enough for programs to not 
overriding each other.

Or, when we want to give computer input through the keyboard, 
without an OS, an application also has to carry code to 
facilitate the communication with keyboard hardware; each 
application then handles such keyboard communication on its own. 
Why should there be such duplications across applications for 
such standard feature? If you write an accounting software, why 
should a programmer concern writing a keyboard driver, totally 
irrelevant to the problem domain?

That's why a crucial job of an OS is to hide the complexity of 
hardware devices, so a program is freed from the burden of 
maintaining its own code for hardware communication by having a 
standardized set of interfaces and thus, reduce potential bugs 
along with faster development time.

To write an OS effectively, a programmer need to understand well 
the underlying computer architecture that programmer are writing 
an OS for. The first reason is, many OS concepts are supported by 
the architecture e.g. the concepts of virtual memory are well 
supported by x86 architecture. If the underlying computer 
architecture is not well-understood, OS developers are doomed to 
reinvent it in your OS, and such software-implemented solutions 
run slower than the hardware version.

  Drivers

Drivers are programs that enable an OS to communicate and use 
features of hardware devices. For example, a keyboard driver 
enables an OS to get input from keyboard; or a network driver 
allows a network card to send and receive data packets to and 
from the Internet.

If you only write application programs, you may wonder how can 
software control hardware devices? As mentioned in Chapter 2, 
through the hardware-software interface: by writing to a device's 
registers or to write to ports of a device, through the use of 
CPU's instructions. 

  Userspace and kernel space

Kernel space refers to the working environment of an OS that only 
the kernel can access. Kernel space includes the direct 
communication with hardware, or manipulate privileged memory 
regions (such as kernel code and data).

In contrast, userspace refers to less privileged processes that 
run above the OS, and is supervised by the OS. To access the 
kernel facility, user program must go through the standardized 
system programming interfaces provided by the OS.

  Process

  Task

A task is a unit of work that an OS needs to do, similar to how 
human have tasks to do daily. From a user point of view, a task 
for a computer to do can be web browsing, document editing, 
gaming, sending and receiving emails... Since a CPU can only 
execute sequentially, one instruction after another (fetching 
from main memory), there must be some way to do many meaningful 
tasks at once. For that reason, the computer must share the 
resources e.g. registers, stack, memory... between tasks, since 
we have many tasks but single and limited resources.

  Process

Process is a data structure that keeps track of the execution 
state of a task. Task is a general concept, and process is the 
implementation of a task. In a general-purpose OS, a task is 
usually a program. For example, when you run Firefox, a process 
structure is created to keep track of where the stack and the 
heap allocated for firefox are, where Firefox's code area is and 
which instruction EIP is holding to execute next... The typical 
process structure looks like this:

[insert process image]

Process is a virtual computer, but much more primitive than the 
virtual machine in virtualization software like Virtual Box, and 
that's a good thing. Imagine having to run a full-fledged virtual 
machine for every task; how wasteful of machine resources that 
would be.. In the view of a running process, its code executes as 
if it runs directly on hardware. Each process has its own set of 
register values, which are kept tracked by the OS, and its own 
contiguous virtual memory space (which is discontiguous in actual 
physical memory). The code in a process is given virtual memory 
addresses to read and write from.

[ illustrate: - a process looks like a mini Von Neumann - with 
contiguous memory, each with a color; each cell of a process 
mapped to distant memory cell in physical memory ]

A process can run so much until the OS tells it to temporary stop 
for other tasks to use the hardware resources. The suspended 
process can then wait until further notice from the OS. This 
whole switching process is so fast that a computer user think his 
computer actually runs tasks in parallel. The program that does 
the switching between tasks is called a *scheduler*.

  Scheduler

An OS needs to perform a wide range of different functionalities, 
e.g. web browsing, document editing, gaming... A scheduler 
decides which tasks got to run before the others and, for how 
long, in an efficient manner. Scheduler enables your computer to 
become a time sharing system, because tasks share CPU execution 
time and no one process can monopolize the CPU (in practice, it 
still happens regularly). Without a scheduler, only a single task 
can be performed at a time.

  Context switch

When a process is prepared to be switched out for another process 
to take its place, certain hardware resources i.e. current open 
files, current register values... must be backed up to later 
resume that process's execution.

  Priority

Priority is an important metric for OS to decide which task is 
scheduled to run before the others to allocate appropriate CPU 
execution time for each task.

  Preemptive vs Non-preemptive

A preemptive OS can interrupt an executing process and switch to 
another process.

A non-preemtive OS, a task runs until its completion.

  Process states

State is a particular condition of a process, triggered by an 
action from the scheduler. A process goes through various states 
during its life cycle. A process typically has these states:

  Run indicating CPU is executing code in this process.

  Sleep (or Suspended): indicating CPU is executing some process 
  else.

  Destroyed: process is done and waiting to be destroyed 
  completely.

  Threads

Threads are units of work inside a process that shares the 
execution environment. A process creates a whole new execution 
environment with code of its own:

[illustration between process and thread, with each process is a 
big rectangle box and threads nested boxes point to different 
code region]

Instead of creating a completely new process structure in memory, 
OS simply let the thread uses some of the resources of the parent 
process that created it. A thread has its own registers, program 
counter, stack pointer, and its own call stack. Everything else 
is shared between the threads, such as an address space, heap, 
static data, and code segments, and file descriptors. Because 
thread simply reuses existing resources and involve no context 
switching, it is much faster to create and switch between 
processes.

However, note that the above scheme is just an implementation of 
thread concept. You can completely treat thread the same as 
process (hence you can call all processes threads and vice 
versa). Or you can just back up some resources, whlie leaving 
some resources shared. It's up to the OS designer to distinguish 
between threads and processes. Threads are usually implemented as 
a component of a process.

On Linux, a thread is simply a process that shares resources with 
its parent process; for that reason, a Linux thread is also 
called *light-weight process*. Or put it another way, a thread in 
Linux is merely an implementation of a single-threaded process 
that execute its main program code. A multi-threaded program in 
Linux is just a process with shared with its single-threaded 
children processes, each points to different code region of its 
parent process.

[TODO: turn the above table into a diagram]

On Windows, threads and processes are two separated entities, so 
the above description for Linux does not apply. However, the 
general idea: a thread shares the execution environment, holds.

Memory management

  Address Space

Address space is the set of all addressable memory locations. 
There are 2 types of address spaces in physical memory address:

• One for memory: 

• One for I/O:

Each process has its own address space to do whatever it wants, 
as long as the physical memory is not exhausted. This address 
space is called virtual memory.

  Virtual Memory

Physical memory is a contagious memory locations that has a 
simple mapping between a physical memory address and its 
corresponding location in memory, decoded by memory controller. 
On the other hand, *virtual memory* does not have direct mapping 
between a memory address and the corresponding physical memory 
location, even though it appears contagious from the view of an 
userspace program. Instead, virtual memory address is translated 
by OS into an actual physical memory address. For that reason, 
even addresses appear next to each other in virtual memory space, 
they are scattered through out the physical memory.

Why virtual memory is needed? Because virtual memory reduces the 
complexity of programming, by giving each program an illusion 
that it has its own separate "physical" memory to work with. 
Without virtual memory, programs must know and agree with each 
other their own memory regions to not accidentally destroy each 
other.

[illustration a world without virtual memory]

Virtual memory also enables a more secured OS, as application 
programs cannot manipulate main memory directly, so malicious 
programs won't cause havocs by destroying main memory and 
possibly hardware devices, by gaining access to hardware I/O 
ports.

Another benefit is that virtual memory can extend beyond physical 
memory, by storing its data to hard disk. By swapping some of 
unused memory (i.e. inactive memory of a sleeping process), the 
system gains some free memory to continue running, so no data is 
destroyed. Otherwise, the OS is forced to kill a random user 
process to free up some memory, and you may lose unsaved work 
that belongs to the killed process. However, this process can 
significantly slow down the whole system because of Von Neumann 
bottleneck. In the old days, when memory was scarce, it was 
useful.

File System

File system is a mechanism on how raw bytes in a storage device 
can be meaningfully managed. That is, a group of bytes at 
specific locations in a storage device can be allocated for a 
purpose e.g. storing raw ASCII document, and later the exact 
chunks of bytes can be retrieved correctly. File system manages 
many such groups of bytes. It's helpful to think a file system as 
a database that maps between high level information and specific 
locations in a hard disk, similar to how business information is 
mapped to a specific row in a table. The high level information 
that is relevant to a file system is organized as *files* and 
*directories*.

[illustration between a file system and a database table to see 
how they are similar]

File is an entity that includes two components: metadata and the 
actual raw data. Metadata is the information describes the 
properties of the raw data associated with the file; raw data are 
real content of a file. Directory is a file that holds a group of 
files and also child directories. Together, they create a file 
hierarchy system as commonly seen in Windows or Linux.
