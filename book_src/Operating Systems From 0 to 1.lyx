Greetings!

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
You've probably asked yourself at least once how an operating system is
 written from the ground up.
 You might even have years of programming experience under your belt, yet
 your understanding of operating systems may still be a collection of abstract
 concepts not grounded in actual implementation.
 To those who've never built one, an operating system may seem like magic:
 a mysterious thing that can control hardware while handling a programmer's
 requests via the API of their favorite programming language.
 Learning how to build an operating system seems intimidating and difficult;
 no matter how much you learn, it never feels like you know enough.
 You're probably reading this book right now to gain a better understanding
 of operating systems to be a better software engineer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If that is the case, this book is for you.
 By going through this book, you will be able to find the missing pieces
 that are essential and enable you to implement your own operating system
 from scratch! Yes, from scratch without going through any existing operating
 system layer to prove to yourself that you are an operating system developer.
 You may ask,
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't it more practical to learn the internals of Linux?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and no.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Learning Linux can help your workflow at your day job.
 However, if you follow that route, you still won't achieve the ultimate
 goal of writing an actual operating system.
 By writing your own operating system, you will gain knowledge that you
 will not be able to glean just from learning Linux.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a list of some benefits of writing your own OS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You will learn how a computer works at the hardware level, and you will
 learn to write software to manage that hardware directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You will learn the fundamentals of operating systems, allowing you to adapt
 to any operating system, not just Linux
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To hack on Linux internals suitably, you'll need to write at least one operating
 system on your own.
 This is just like applications programming: to write a large application,
 you'll need to start with simple ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You will open pathways to various low-level programming domains such as
 reverse engineering, exploits, building virtual machines, game console
 emulation and more.
 Assembly language will become one of your most indispensable tools for
 low-level analysis.
 (But that does not mean you have to write your operating system in Assembly!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Writing an operating system is fun!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*

\emph on
Why another book on Operating Systems?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many books and courses on this topic made by famous professors
 and experts out there already.
 Who am I to write a book on such an advanced topic? While it's true that
 many quality resources exist, I find them lacking.
 Do any of them show you how to compile your C code and the C runtime library
 independent of an existing operating system? Most books on operating system
 design and implementation only discuss the software side; how the operating
 system communicates with the hardware is skipped.
 Important hardware details are skipped, and it's difficult for a self-learner
 to find relevant resources on the Internet.
 The aim of this book is to bridge that gap: not only will you learn how
 to program hardware directly, but also how to read official documents from
 hardware vendors to program it.
 You no longer have to seek out resources to help yourself interpret hardware
 manuals and documentation: you can do it yourself.
 Lastly, I wrote this book from an autodidact's perspective.
 I made this book as self-contained as possible so you can spend more time
 learning and less time guessing or seeking out information on the Internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the core focuses of this book is to guide you through the process
 of reading official documentation from vendors to implement your software.
 Official documents from hardware vendors like Intel are critical for implementi
ng an operating system or any other software that directly controls the
 hardware.
 At a minimum, an operating system developer needs to be able to comprehend
 these documents and implement software based on a set of hardware requirements.
 Thus, the first chapter is dedicated to discussing relevant documents and
 their importance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another distinct feature of this book is that it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello World
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 centric.
 Most examples revolve around variants of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello World
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 program, which will acquaint you with core concepts.
 These concepts must be learned before attempting to write an operating
 system.
 Anything beyond a simple 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello World
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 example gets in the way of teaching the concepts, thus lengthening the
 time spent on getting started writing an operating system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's dive in.
 With this book, I hope to provide enough foundational knowledge that will
 open doors for you to make sense of other resources.
 This book is will be especially beneficial to students who've just finished
 their first C/C++ course.
 Imagine how cool it would be to show prospective employers that you've
 already built an operating system.

 typing speed should be fast enough not to let it get it the way and degrade
 the learning experience.

1 provides a foundation for learning operating system.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Chapter 1 briefly explains the importance of domain documents.
 Documents are crucial for the learning experience, so they deserve a chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Chapter 2 explains the layers of abstractions from hardware to software.
 The idea is to provide insight into how code runs physically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Chapter 3 provides the general architecture of a computer, then introduces
 a sample computer model that you will use to write an operating system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Chapter 4 introduces the x86 assembly language through the use of the Intel
 manuals, along with commonly used instructions.
 This chapter gives detailed examples of how high-level syntax corresponds
 to low-level assembly, enabling you to read generated assembly code comfortably.
 It is necessary to read assembly code when debugging an operating system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Chapter 5 dissects ELF in detail.
 Only by understanding how the structure of a program at the binary level,
 you can build one that runs on bare metal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Chapter 6 introduces 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 debugger with extensive examples for commonly used commands.
 After acquainting the reader with 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
, it then provides insight on how a debugger works.
 This knowledge is essential for building a debuggable program on the bare
 metal.
 
\end_layout

Chapter 7 introduces what the bootloader is, how to write one in assembly,
 and how to load it on QEMU, a hardware emulator.
 This process involves typing repetitive and long commands, so GNU Make
 is applied to improve productivity by automating the repetitive parts and
 simplifying the interaction with the project.
 This chapter also demonstrates the use of GNU Make in context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Chapter 8 introduces linking by explaining the relocation process when combining
 object files.
 In addition to a bootloader and an operating system written in C, this
 is the last piece of the puzzle required for building debuggable programs
 on bare metal, including the bootloader written in Assembly and an operating
 system written in C.

\begin_layout Description
Part

3 provides guidance on how to write an operating system, as you should implement
 an operating system on your own and be proud of your creation.
 The guidance consists of simpler and coherent explanations of necessary
 concepts, from hardware to software, to implement the features of an operating
 system.
 Without such guidance, you will waste time gathering information spread
 through various documents and the Internet.
 It then provides a plan on how to map the concepts to code.

 Not only a software engineer needs to understand how to implement the software,
 but also the problem domain that it tries to solve, which might require
 in-depth expert knowledge.
 The software engineer must also select the right programming techniques
 that are apply to the problem domain he is trying to solve because many
 techniques that are effective in one domain might not be in another.
 For example, many types of applications do not require performant written
 code, but a short time to market.
 In this case, interpreted languages are widely popular because it can satisfy
 such need.
 However, for writing huge 3D games or operating system, compiled languages
 are dominant because it can generate the most efficient code required for
 such applications.

One example of such scenario is the domain that is presenting in this book:
 
\emph on
operating system

.
 A certain amount of electrical engineering (EE) knowledge is required to
 implement an operating system.
 If a computer science (CS) curriculum that does not include minimum EE
 courses, students in the curriculum have little chance to implement a working
 operating system.
 Even if they can implement one, either they need to invest a significant
 amount of time to study on their own, or they fill code in a predefined
 framework just to understand high-level algorithms.
 For that reason, EE students have an easier time to implement an OS, as
 they only need to study a few core CS courses.

\begin_layout Standard
One thing to note is that software is its own problem domain.
 A problem domain does not necessarily divide between software and itself.
 Compilers, 3D graphics, games, cryptography, artificial intelligence, etc.,
 are parts of software engineering domains (actually it is more of a computer
 science domain than a software engineering domain).
 In general, a software-exclusive domain creates software to be used by
 other software.
 Operating System is also a domain, but is overlapped with other domain
 such as electrical engineering.
 To effectively implement an operating system, it is required to learn enough
 of the external domain.
 How much learning is enough for a software engineer? At the minimum, a
 software engineer should be knowledgeable enough to understand the documents
 prepared by hardware engineers for using (i.e.
 programming) their devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Learning a programming language, even C or Assembly, does not mean a software
 engineer can automatically be good at hardware programming or any related
 low-level programming domains.
 One can spend 10 years, 20 years or his entire life writing C/C++ code,
 and he still cannot write an operating system, simply because of the ignorant
 of relevant domain knowledge.
 Just like learning English does not mean a person automatically becomes
 good at reading Math books written in English.
 Much more than that is needed.
 Knowing one or two programming languages is not enough.
 If a programmer writes software for a living, he should better be specialized
 in one or two problem domains outside of software if he does not want his
 job taken by domain experts who learn programming in their spare time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Documents for implementing a problem domain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Documents are essential for learning a problem domain (and actually, anything)
 since information can be passed down in a reliable way.
 It is evident that this written text has been used for thousands of years
 to pass knowledge from generations to generations.
 Documents are integral parts of non-trivial projects.
 Without the documents:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
New people will find it much harder to join a project.

It is challenging for customers to understand the product they are going
 to use.
 However, documents do not need to be written in book format.
 It can be anything from HTML format to database format to be displayed
 by a graphical user interface.
 Important information must be stored somewhere safe, readily accessible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many types of documents.
 However, to facilitate the understanding of a problem domain, these two
 documents need to be written:

\begin_layout Standard
A software solves a business problem.
 But, which problems to solve, are requested by a customer.
 Many of these requests make a list of requirements that our software needs
 to fulfill.
 However, an enumerated list of features is seldom useful in delivering
 software.
 As stated in the previous section, the tricky part is not programming alone
 but programming according to a problem domain.
 The bulk of software design and implementation depends upon the knowledge
 of the problem domain.
 The better understood the domain, the higher quality software can be.
 For example, building a house is practiced over thousands of years and
 is well understood, and it is easy to build a high-quality house; software
 is no difference.
 Code that is difficult to understand, usually because of the ignorance
 of problem domain.
 In the context of this book, we sought to understand the low-level working
 of various hardware devices.

\begin_layout Standard
Because software quality depends upon the understandings of the problem
 domain, the amount of software requirement document should consist of problem
 domain description.

\begin_layout Standard
Software requirement document is all about the problem domain.
 It should not be a high-level description of an implementation.
 Some problems might seem straightforward to map directly from its domain
 description to the structure of an implementation.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Users are given a list of books in a 
\series bold
\emph on
drop-down menu
\series default
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the future, instead of a drop-down menu, all books are listed directly
 on a page in thumbnails.
 Books might be reimplemented as a graph, and each node is a book for finding
 related books, as a recommender is going to be added in the next version.
 The requirement document needs updating again to remove all the outdated
 implementation details, thus required additional efforts to maintain the
 requirement document, and when the effort for syncing with the implementation
 is too much, the developers give up documentation, and everyone starts
 ranting how useless documentation is.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More often than not there is no straightforward one-to-one mapping.
 For example, a regular computer user expects OS to be something that runs
 some program with GUI, or their favorite computer games.
 But for such requirements, an operating system is implemented as multiple
 layers, each hides the details from the upper layers.
 To implement an operating system, a large body of knowledge from multiple
 fields are required, especially if the operating system runs on non-PC
 devices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's better to put anything related to the problem domain in the requirement
 document.
 A good way to test the quality of requirement document is to hand it to
 the domain expert for proofreading if he can understand the material thoroughly.
 Requirement document is also useful as a help document later, or for writing
 one much easier.

 parts of the problem domain must obey.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simply put, software specification is interface design, with constraints
 for the problem domain to follow e.g.
 the software can accept certain types of input such as the software is
 designed to accept English but no other language.
 For a hardware device, a specification is always needed, as software depends
 on its hardwired behaviors.
 And in fact, it is mostly the case that hardware specifications are well-define
d, with the tiniest details in it.
 It needs to be that way because once hardware is physically manufactured,
 there's no going back, and if defects exist, it's a devastating damage
 to the company on both finance and reputation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, similar to a requirement document, a specification only concerns
 interface design.
 If implementation details leak in, it is a burden to sync between the actual
 implementation and the specification, and soon to be abandoned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important remark is that, though a specification document is important,
 it does not have to be produced 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the implementation.
 It can be prepared in any order: before or after a complete implementation;
 or at the same time with the implementation, when some part is done, and
 the interface is ready to be recorded in the specification.
 Regardless of methods, what matter is a complete specification at the end.

When problem domain is different from software domain, requirement document
 and specification are usually separated.
 However, if the problem domain is inside software, specification most often
 includes both, and content of both can be mixed with each other.
 As demonstrated by previous sections the importance of documents, to implement
 an OS, we will need to collects relevant documents to gain sufficient domain
 knowledge.
 These documents are as follow:

All electronic devices, from simple to complex, manipulate this flow to
 achieve desired effects in the real world.
 Computers are no exception.
 When we write software, we indirectly manipulate electrical current at
 the physical level, in such a way that the underlying machine produces
 desired effects.
 To understand the process, we consider a simple light bulb.
 A light bulb can change two states between on and off with a switch, periodical
ly: an off means number 0, and an on means 1.

 All computer operations are built from the combinations of logic gates,

 Later, Charles Sanders Peirce (during 1880 -- 1881) proved that either
 Boolean function of NOR or NAND alone is enough to create all other Boolean
 logic functions.
 Thus NOR and NAND gates are functionally complete

 Gates are simply the implementations of Boolean logic functions, therefore

 The simplest gates CMOS circuit can implement are inverters (NOT gates)
 and from the inverters, comes NAND gates.
 With NAND gates, we are confident to implement everything else.
 This is why the inventions of transistors, then CMOS circuit revolutionized

From NAND gate, we have all other gates.
 As demonstrated, such a simple circuitry performs the logical operators
 in day-to-day program languages e.g.
 NOT operator 
\family typewriter
~
\family default
 is executed directly by an inverter circuit, and operator 
\family typewriter
&
\family default
 is executed by an AND circuit and so on.
 Code does not run on magic a black box.
 In contrast, code execution is precise and transparent, often as simple
 as running some hardwired circuit.
 When we write software, we simply manipulate electrical current at the
 physical level to run appropriate circuits to produce desired outcomes.
 However, this whole process somehow does not relate to any thought involving
 electrical current.
 That is the real magic and will be explained soon.

 All logic gates are built by pairs of NMOS and PMOS transistors, and gates
 are the building blocks of all digital devices from simple to complex,
 including any computer.
 Thanks to this pattern, it is possible to separate between the actual physical
 circuit implementation and logical implementation.
 Digital designs are done by designing with logic gates then later be

 In fact, later we will see that logic gates become a language that describes
 how circuits operate.
 Understanding how CMOS works is important to understand how a computer
 is designed, and as a consequence, how a computer works

74HC00 is a chip with four 2-input NAND gates.
 The chip comes with 8 input pins and 4 output pins, 1 pin for connecting
 to a voltage source and 1 pin for connecting to the ground.
 This device is the physical implementation of NAND gates that we can physically
 touch and use.
 But instead of just a single gate, the chip comes with 4 gates that can
 be combined.
 Each combination enables a different logic function, effective creating
 other logic gates.
 This feature is what make the chip popular.

Why does such a bit pattern cause a device to do something? The reason is
 that underlying each instruction is a small circuit that implements the
 instruction.
 Similar to how a function/subroutine in a computer program is called by
 its name, a bit pattern is a name of a little function inside a CPU that
 got executed when the CPU finds one.

 CPU is just a name to indicate a hardware device that controls a computer

 A device with its own machine language is a

The functional description provides a truth table with all possible pin
 inputs and outputs, which also describes the usage of all pins in the device.
 A user needs not to know the implementation, but on such a table to use
 the device.
 We can say that the truth table above is the machine language of the device.
 Since the device is digital, its language is a collection of binary strings:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The device has 8 input pins, and this means it accepts binary strings of
 8 bits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The device has 4 output pins, and this means it produces binary strings
 of 4 bits from the 8-bit inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of input strings is what the device understand, and the number
 of output strings is what the device can speak.
 Together, they make the language of the device.
 Even though this device is simple, yet the language it can accept contains
 quite many binary strings: 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{8}+2^{4}=272$
\end_inset

.
 However, the number is a tiny fraction of a complex device like a CPU,
 with hundreds of pins.

 maximum.

On the other hand, if OR gate is implemented, we can only build a 2-input
 OR gate from 74HC00, as it requires 3 NAND gates: 2 input NAND gates and
 1 output NAND gate.
 Each input NAND gate represents only a 1-bit input of the OR gate.
 In the following figure, the pins of each input NAND gates are always set
 to the same values (either both inputs are A or both inputs are B) to represent
 a single bit input for the final OR gate:

\begin_layout Subsection
Assembly Language
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assembly language is the symbolic representation of binary machine code,
 by giving bit patterns mnemonic names.
 It was a vast improvement when programmers had to write 0 and 1.
 For example, instead of writing 
\family typewriter
000000101
\family default
, a programmer simply write 
\family typewriter
hlt
\family default
 to stop a computer.
 Such an abstraction makes instructions executed by a CPU easier to remember,
 and thus more instructions could be memorized, less time spent looking
 up CPU manual to find instructions in bit forms and as a result, code was
 written faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understand assembly language is crucial for low-level programming domains,
 even to this day.
 The more instructions a programmer want to understand, the deeper understanding
 of machine architecture is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
We can build a device with 2 assembly instructions:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
or   <op1>, <op2>
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
nand <op1>, <op2>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
or
\family default
 accepts two 4-bit operands.
 This corresponds to a 4-input OR gate device built from 4 74HC00 chips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
nand
\family default
 accepts two 4-bit operands.
 This corresponds to a single 74HC00 chips, leave as is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Essentially, the gates in the example 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "exa:74HC00-chip-can"

\end_inset

 implements the instructions.
 Up to this point, we only specify input and output and manually feed it
 to a device.
 That is, to perform an operation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pick a device by hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manually put electrical signals into pins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we want to automate the process of device selection.
 That is, we want to simply write assembly instruction and the device that
 implements the instruction is selected correctly.
 Solving this problem is easy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Give each instruction an index in binary code, called 
\emph on
operation code
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
opcode
\emph default
 for short, and embed it as part of input.
 The value for each instruction is specified as in table

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Each input now contains additional data at the beginning: an opcode.
 For example, the instruction:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\color red
nand
\color inherit
 1100, 1100
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
corresponds to the binary string: 
\family typewriter
\color red
00
\color inherit
11001100
\family default
.
 The first two bits 
\family typewriter
\color red
00
\family default
\color inherit
 encodes a 
\family typewriter
nand
\family default
 instruction, as listed in the table above.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Add another device to select a device, based on a binary code peculiar to
 an instruction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a device is called a 
\emph on
decoder
\emph default
, an important component in a CPU that decides which circuit to use.
 In the above example, when feeding 
\family typewriter
\color red
00
\color inherit
11001100
\family default
 to the decoder, because the opcode is 
\family typewriter
\color red
00
\family default
\color inherit
, data are sent to NAND device for computing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, writing assembly code is just an easier way to write binary strings
 that a device can understand.
 When we write assembly code and save in a text file, a program called an
 
\emph on

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
\emph on

\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
assembler
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
 translates the text file into binary strings that a device can understand.
 So, how can an assembler exist in the first place? Assume this is the first
 assembler in the world, then it is written in binary code.
 In the next version, life is easier: the programmers write the assembler
 in the assembly code, then use the first version to compile itself.
 These binary strings are then stored in another device that later can be
 retrieved and sent to a decoder.

\end_layout

\end_inset

storage device
\emph default
 is the device that stores machine instructions, which is an array of circuits
 for saving 0 and 1 states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A decoder is built out of logic gates similar to other digital devices.
 However, a storage device can be anything that can store 0 and 1 and is
 retrievable.
 A storage device can be a magnetized device that uses magnetism to store
 information, or it can be made out of electrical circuits using.
 Regardless of the technology used, as long as the device can store data
 and is accessible to retrieve data, it suffices.
 Indeed, the modern devices are so complex that it is impossible and unnecessary
 to understand every implementation detail.
 Instead, we only need to learn the interfaces, e.g.
 the pins, that the devices expose.

\emph on

\emph default
 an instruction from a storage device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 the instruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

\emph default
 the instruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or in short, a 
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fetch -- decode -- execute
\end_layout

\end_inset

fetch -- decode -- execute cycle.
 The above device is extremely rudimentary, but it already represents a
 computer with a 
\emph on
fetch
\emph default
 -- 
\emph on
decode
\emph default
 -- 
\emph on
execute
\emph default
 cycle.
 More instructions can be implemented by adding more devices and allocating
 more opcodes for the instructions, then update the decoder accordingly.
 The Apollo Guidance Computer, a digital computer produced for the Apollo
 space program from 1961 -- 1972, was built entirely with NOR gates - the
 other choice to NAND gate for creating other logic gates.
 Similarly, if we keep improving our hypothetical device, it eventually
 becomes a full-fledge computer.

Programming Languages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assembly language is a step up from writing 0 and 1.
 As time goes by, people realized that many pieces of assembly code had
 repeating patterns of usages.
 It would be nice if instead of writing all the repeating blocks of code
 all over again in all places, we simply refer to such blocks of code with
 easier to use text forms.
 For example, a block of assembly code checks whether one variable is greater
 than another and if so, execute a block of code, else execute another block
 of code; in C, such block of assembly code is represented by an

\begin_layout Standard
Any software logic a programming language can implement, hardware can also
 implement.
 The reverse is also true: any hardware logic that is implemented in a circuit
 can be reimplemented in a programming language.
 The simple reason is that programming languages, or assembly languages,
 or machine languages, or logic gates are just languages to express computations.
 It is impossible for software to implement something hardware is incapable
 of because programming language is just a simpler way to use the underlying
 hardware.
 At the end of the day, programming languages are translated to machine
 instructions that are valid to a CPU.
 Otherwise, code is not runnable, thus a useless software.
 In reverse, software can do everything hardware (that run the software)
 can, as programming languages are just an easier way to use the hardware.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In reality, even though all languages are equivalent in power, not all of
 them are capable of express programs of each other.
 Programming languages vary between two ends of a spectrum: high level and
 low level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The higher level a programming language is, the distant it becomes with
 hardware.
 In some high-level programming languages, such as Python, a programmer
 cannot manipulate underlying hardware, despite being able to deliver the
 same computations as low-level programming languages.
 The reason is that high-level languages want to hide hardware details to
 free programmers from dealing with irrelevant details not related to current
 problem domains.
 Such convenience, however, is not free: it requires software to carry an
 extra code for managing hardware details (e.g.
 memory) thus making the code run slower, and it makes hardware programming
 difficult or impossible.
 The more abstractions a programming language imposes, the more difficult
 it is for writing low-level software, such as hardware drivers or an operating
 system.
 This is the reason why C is usually a language of choice for writing an
 operating system, since C is just a thin wrapper of the underlying hardware,
 making it easy to understand how exactly a hardware device runs when executing
 a certain piece of C code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each programming language represents a way of thinking about programs.
 Higher-level programming languages help to focus on problem domains that
 are not related to hardware at all, and where programmer performance is
 more important than computer performance.
 Lower-level programming languages help to focus on the inner-working of
 a machine, thus are best suited for problem domains that are related to
 control hardware.
 That is why so many languages exist.
 Use the right tools for the right job to achieve the best results.

\emph default
is a technique for hiding complexity that is irrelevant to the problem in
 context.
 For example, writing programs without any other layer except the lowest
 layer: with circuits.
 Not only a person needs an in-depth understanding of how circuits work,
 making it much more obscure to design a circuit because the designer must
 look at the raw circuits but think in higher-level such as logic gates.
 It is a distracting process, as a designer must constantly translate the
 idea into circuits.
 It is possible for a designer simply thinks his high-level ideas straight,
 and later translate the ideas into circuits.
 Not only it is more efficient, but it is also more accurate as a designer
 can focus all his efforts into verifying the design with high-level thinking.
 When a new designer arrives, he can easily understand the high-level designs,
 thus can continue to develop or maintain existing systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why abstraction works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all the layers, abstractions manifest itself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Logic gates abstract away the details of CMOS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Machine language abstracts away the details of logic gates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assembly language abstracts away the details of machine languages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Programming language abstracts away the details of assembly languages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see repeating patterns of how lower-layers build upper-layers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A lower layer has a recurring pattern.
 Then, this recurring pattern is taken out and built a language on top of
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A higher layer strips away layer-specific (non-recurring) details to focus
 on the recurring details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The recurring details are given a new and simpler language than the languages
 of the lower layers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What to realize is that every layer is just
\emph on
 a more convenient language to 
\series bold
describe
\series default
 the lower layer
\emph default
.
 Only after a description is fully created with the language of the higher
 layer, it is then be 
\emph on
implemented
\emph default
 with the language of the lower layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CMOS layer has a recurring pattern that makes sure logic gates are reliably
 translated to CMOS circuits: 
\series bold
\emph on
a k-input gate uses k PMOS and k NMOS transistors
\series default
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Since digital devices use CMOS exclusively, a language arose to describe
 higher level ideas while hiding CMOS circuits: Logic Gates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Logic Gates hides the language of circuits and focuses on how to implement
 primitive Boolean functions and combine them to create new functions.
 All logic gates receive input and generate output as binary numbers.
 Thanks to this recurring patterns, logic gates are hidden away for the
 new language: Assembly, which is a set of predefined binary patterns that
 cause the underlying gates to perform an action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Soon, people realized that many recurring patterns arisen from within Assembly
 language.
 Repeated blocks of Assembly code appear in Assembly source files that express
 the same or similar idea.
 There were many such ideas that can be reliably translated into Assembly
 code.
 Thus, the ideas were extracted for building into the high level programming
 languages that everyone programmer learns today.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recurring patterns are the key to abstraction.
 Recurring patterns are why abstraction works.
 Without them, no language can be built, and thus no abstraction.
 Fortunately, human already developed a systematic discipline for studying
 patterns: Mathematics.
 As quoted from the British mathematician G.
 H.
 Hardy

\begin_layout Quote
A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns.
 If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are
 made with ideas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Isn't that a mathematical formula a representation of a pattern? A variable
 represents values with the same properties given by constraints? Mathematics
 provides a formal system to identify and describe existing patterns in
 nature.
 For that reason, this system can certainly be applied in the digital world,
 which is just a subset of the real world.
 Mathematics can be used as a common language to help translation between
 layers easier, and help with the understanding of layers.

Why abstraction reduces complexity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Abstraction by building language certainly leverages productivity by stripping
 irrelevant details to a problem.
 Imagine writing programs without any other layout except the lowest layer:
 with circuits.
 This is how complexity emerges: when high-level ideas are expressed with
 lower-level language, as the example above demonstrated.
 Unfortunately, this is the case with software as programming languages
 at the moment are more emphasized on software rather than the problem domains.
 That is, without prior knowledge, code written in a language is unable
 to express itself the knowledge of its target domain.
 In other words, 
\emph on
a language is expressive if its syntax is designed to express the problem
 domain it is trying to solve
\emph default
.
 Consider this example: That is, the 
\emph on
what
\emph default
 it will do rather the 
\emph on
how
\emph default
 it will do.

Graphviz (

\begin_layout Plain Layout

) is a visualization software that provides a language, called 
\family typewriter
dot
\family default
, for describing graph:

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen, the code perfectly expresses itself how the graph is connected.
 Even a non-programmer can understand and use such language easily.
 If it were to implement in C, it would be more troublesome, and this is
 assuming that the functions for drawing graphs are already available.
 To draw a line, in C we might write something like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
draw_line(a, b);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it is still verbose compared with:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
a -> b;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, 
\family typewriter
a
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
b
\family default
 must be defined in C, compared to the implicit nodes in the 
\family typewriter
dot
\family default
 language.
 However, if we do not factor in the verbosity, then C still has a limitation:
 it cannot change its syntax to suit the problem domain.
 A domain-specific language might even be more verbose, but it makes a domain
 more understandable.
 If a problem domain must be expressed in C, then it is constraint by the
 syntax of C.
 Since C is not a specialized language for a problem domain that, but is
 a 
\emph on
general-purpose
\emph default
 programming language, the domain knowledge is buried within the implementation
 details.
 As a result, a C programmer is needed to decipher and extract the domain
 knowledge out.
 If the domain knowledge cannot be extracted, then the software cannot be
 further developed.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout --Separator--

\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Linux is full of applications controlled by many domain-specific languages
 and are placed in 
\family typewriter
/etc
\family default
 directory, such as a web server.
 Instead of reprogramming the software, a domain-agnostic language is made
 for it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, code that can express a problem domain must be understandable
 by a domain expert.
 Even within the software domain, building a language out of repeated programmin
g patterns is useful.
 It helps people aware the existence of such patterns in code and thus making
 software easier to maintain, as software structure is visible as a language.
 Only a programming language that is capable of morphing itself to suit
 a problem domain can achieve that goal.
 Such language is called a 
\emph on
programmable programming language
\emph default
.
 Unfortunately, this approach of turning software structure visible is not
 favored among programmers, as a new language must be made out of it along
 with new toolchain to support it.
 Thus, software structure and domain knowledge are buried within code written
 in the syntax of a general-purpose language, and if a programmer is not
 familiar or even aware of the existence of a code pattern, then it is hopeless
 to understand the code.
 A prime example is reading C code that controls hardware, e.g.
 an operating system: if a programmer knows absolutely nothing about hardware,
 then it is impossible to read and write operating system code in C, even
 if he could have 20 years of writing application C code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With abstraction, a software engineer can also understand the inner-working
 of a device without specialized knowledge of physical circuit design, enables
 the software engineer to write code that controls a device.
 The separation between logical and physical implementation also entails
 that gate designs can be reused even when the underlying technologies changed.
 For example, in some distant future biological computer could be a reality,
 and gates might not be implemented as CMOS but some kind of biological
 cells e.g.
 as living cells; in either technology: electrical or biological, as long
 as logic gates are physically realized, the same computer design could
 be implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Computer Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To write lower level code, a programmer must understand the architecture
 of a computer.
 It is similar to when one writes programs in a software framework, he must
 know what kinds of problems the framework solves, and how to use the framework
 by its provided software interfaces.
 But before getting to the definition of what computer architecture is,
 we must understand what exactly is a computer, as many people still think
 that a computer is a regular computer we put on a desk, or at best, a server.
 Computers come in various shapes and sizes and are devices that people
 never imagine they are computers, and that code can run on such devices.

The line between a microcontroller and a system-on-chip is blurry.
 If hardware keeps evolving more powerful, then a microcontroller can get
 enough resources to run a minimal operating system on it for multiple specializ
ed purposes.
 In contrast, a system-on-chip is powerful enough to handle the job of a
 microcontroller.
 However, using a system-on-chip as a microcontroller would not be a wise
 choice as price will rise significantly, but we also waste hardware resources
 since the software written for a microcontroller requires little computing

 Recall that in the previous chapter, each 74HC00 chip can be configured
 as a gate, and a more sophisticated device can be built by combining multiple
 74HC00 chips.
 In a similar manner, each FPGA device contains thousands of chips called
 
\emph on
logic blocks
\emph default
, which is a more complicated chip than a 74HC00 chip that can be configured
 to implement a Boolean logic function.
 These logic blocks can be chained together to create a high-level hardware
 feature.
 This high-level feature is usually a dedicated algorithm that needs high-speed
 processing.

\begin_layout Standard
Digital devices can be designed by combining logic gates, without regarding
 actual circuit components, since the physical circuits are just multiples
 of CMOS circuits.
 Digital hardware, including various components in a computer, is designed
 by writing code, like a regular programmer, by using a language to describe
 how gates are wired together.
 This language is called a 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between FPGA and other embedded computers is that programs
 in FPGA are implemented at the digital logic level, while programs in embedded
 computers like microcontrollers or system-on-chip devices are implemented
 at assembly code level.
 An algorithm written for a FPGA device is a description of the algorithm
 in logic gates, which the FPGA device then follows the description to configure
 itself to run the algorithm.
 An algorithm written for a microcontroller is in assembly instructions
 that a processor can understand and act accordingly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FPGA is applied in the cases where the specialized operations are unsuitable
 and costly to run on a regular computer such as real-time medical image
 processing, cruise control system, circuit prototyping, video encoding/decoding
, etc.
 These applications require high-speed processing that is not achievable
 with a regular processor because a processor wastes a significant amount
 of time in executing many non-specialized instructions - which might add
 up to thousands of instructions or more - to implement a specialized operation,
 thus more circuits at physical level to carry the same operation.
 A FPGA device carries no such overhead; instead, it runs a single specialized
 operation implemented in hardware directly.

) is a chip designed for a particular purpose rather than for general-purpose
 use.
 ASIC does not contain a generic array of logic blocks that can be reconfigured
 to adapt to any operation like an FPGA; instead, every logic block in an
 ASIC is made and optimized for the circuit itself.
 FPGA can be considered as the prototyping stage of an ASIC, and ASIC as
 the final stage of circuit production.
 ASIC is even more specialized than FPGA, so it can achieve even higher
 performance.
 However, ASICs are very costly to manufacture and once the circuits are
 made, if design errors happen, everything is thrown away, unlike the FPGA
 devices which can simply be reprogrammed because of the generic gate array.

A CPU is an implementation of an ISA, effective the implementation of an
 assembly language (and depends on the CPU architecture, the language may
 vary).
 Assembly language is one of the interfaces that are provided for software
 engineers to control a CPU, thus control a computer.
 But how can every computer device be controlled with only the access to
 the CPU? The simple answer is that a CPU can communicate with other devices
 through these two interfaces, thus commanding them what to do:

\begin_deeper

 some operation according to values written to the port.

 data, but delegate data to some other circuit.
\end_layout

 Memory consists of many cells.
 Each cell is a byte with its address number, so a CPU can use such address
 number to access an exact location in memory.
 Memory is where software instructions (in the form of machine language)
 is stored and retrieved to be executed by CPU; memory also stores data
 needed by some software.
 Memory in a Von Neumann machine does not distinguish between which bytes
 are data and which bytes are software instructions.
 It's up to the software to decide, and if somehow data bytes are fetched
 and executed as instructions, CPU still does it if such bytes represents
 valid instructions, but will produce undesirable results.
 To a CPU, there's no code and data; both are merely different types of
 data for it to act on: one tells it how to do something in a specific manner,
 and one is necessary materials for it to carry such action.

 For example, the Core i7 family provides a model for desktop computers

 laptops is less performant but more energy efficient.
 To write software for a hardware device, seldom we need to understand a
 hardware implementation if documents are available.
 Computer organization and especially the instruction set architecture are

\begin_layout Standard
To write a complete operating system, a programmer needs to understand how
 to program these devices.
 After all, an operating system manages hardware automatically to free applicati
on programs doing so.
 However, of all the components, learning to program the CPU is the most
 important, as it is the component present in any computer, regardless of
 what type a computer is.
 For this reason, the primary focus of this book will be on how to program
 an x86 CPU.
 Even solely focused on this device, a reasonably good minimal operating
 system can be written.
 The reason is that not all computers include all the devices as in a normal
 desktop computer.
 For example, an embedded computer might only have a CPU and limited internal
 memory, with pins for getting input and producing an output; yet, operating
 systems were written for such devices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, learning how to program an x86 CPU is a daunting task, with 3 primary
 manuals written for it: almost 500 pages for volume 1, over 2000 pages
 for volume 2 and over 1000 pages for volume 3.
 It is an impressive feat for a programmer to master every aspect of x86
 CPU programming.

Intel Q35 Chipset
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q35 is an Intel chipset released September 2007.
 Q35 is used as an example of a high-level computer organization because
 later we will use QEMU to emulate a Q35 system, which is latest Intel system
 that QEMU can emulate.
 Though released in 2007, Q35 is relatively modern to the current hardware,
 and the knowledge can still be reused for current chipset model.
 With a Q35 chipset, the emulated CPU is also relatively up-to-date with
 features presented in current day CPUs so we can use the latest software
 manuals from Intel.

\begin_layout Chapter
x86 Assembly and C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we will explore assembly language, and how it connects
 to C.
 But why should we do so? Isn't it better to trust the compiler, plus no
 one writes assembly anymore? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not quite.
 Surely, the compiler at its current state of the art is trustworthy, and
 we do not need to write code in assembly, 
\emph on
most of the time
\emph default
.
 A compiler can generate code, but as mentioned previously, a high-level
 language is a collection of patterns of a lower-level language.
 It does not cover everything that a hardware platform provides.
 As a consequence, not every assembly instruction can be generated by a
 compiler, so we still need to write assembly code for these circumstances
 to access hardware-specific features.
 Since hardware-specific features require writing assembly code, debugging
 requires reading it.
 We might spend even more time reading than writing.
 Working with low-level code that interacts directly with hardware, assembly
 code is unavoidable.
 Also, understand how a compiler generates assembly code could improve a
 programmer's productivity.
 For example, if a job or school assignment requires us to write assembly
 code, we can simply write it in C, then let 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 does the hard working of writing the assembly code for us.
 We merely collect the generated assembly code, modify as needed and be
 done with the assignment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will learn 
\family typewriter
objdump
\family default
 extensively, along with how to use Intel documents to aid in understanding
 x86 assembly code.

 Knowing the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit is crucial for writing
 kernel code.
 We will examine this matter later on when writing our kernel.

\begin_layout Section
Reading the output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the start of the output displays the file format of the object file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
\noindent
\align left
hello: file format elf64-x86-64
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the line is a series of disassembled sections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
\noindent
\align left
Disassembly of section .interp:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
...
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Disassembly of section .note.ABI-tag:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Disassembly of section .note.gnu.build-id:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
...
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
...
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
etc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, each disassembled section displays its actual content - which is
 a sequence of assembly instructions - with the following format:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
\noindent
\align left

\color red
4004d6
\color inherit
:       
\color blue
55
\color inherit
                      
\color green
push   rbp
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\color red
first column
\color inherit
 is the address of an assembly instruction.
 In the above example, the address is 
\family typewriter
0x4004d6
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\color blue
second column
\color inherit
 is assembly instruction in raw hex values.
 In the above example, the address is 
\family typewriter
0x55
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\color green
third column
\color inherit
 is the assembly instruction.
 Depends on the section, the assembly instruction might be meaningful or
 meaningless.
 For example, if the assembly instructions are in a 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 section, then the assembly instructions are actual program code.
 On the other hand, if the assembly instructions are displayed in a 
\family typewriter
.data 
\family default
section, then we can safely ignore the displayed instructions.
 The reason is that 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
objdump
\end_layout

\end_inset

 doesn't know which hex values are code and which are data, so it blindly
 translates every hex values into assembly instructions.
 In the above example, the assembly instruction is 
\family typewriter
push %rbp
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The optional fourth column is a comment - appears when there is a reference
 to an address - to inform where the address originates.
 For example, the comment in 
\color blue

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is to inform that the referenced address from 
\family typewriter
\color red
[rip+0x2008ee]
\family default
\color inherit
 is 
\family typewriter
\color blue
0x600e10
\family default
\color inherit
, where the variable 
\family typewriter
__frame_dummy_init_array_entry
\family default
 resides.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
In a disassembled section, it may also contain 
\emph on
labels
\emph default
.
 A label is a name given to an assembly instruction.
 The label denotes the purpose of an assembly block to a human reader, to
 make it easier to understand.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 section carries many of such labels to denote where code in a program start;
\family typewriter
 .text
\family default
 section below carries two functions: 
\family typewriter
\color red
_start
\family default
\color inherit
 and 
\family typewriter
\color red
deregister_tm_clones
\family default
\color inherit
.
 The 
\family typewriter
\color red
_start
\family default
\color inherit
 function starts at address 
\family typewriter
\color blue
4003e0
\family default
\color inherit
, is annotated to the left of the function name.
 Right below 
\family typewriter
\color red
_start
\color inherit
 
\family default
label is also the instruction at address 
\family typewriter
\color blue
4003e0
\family default
\color inherit
.
 This whole thing means that a label is simply a name of a memory address.
 The function 
\family typewriter
deregister_tm_clones 
\family default
also shares the same format as every function in the section.

 To do so, the most reliable source is to refer to documents provided by

The subsequent sections examine the anatomy of an assembly instruction.
 To fully understand, it is necessary to write code and see the code in
 its actual form displayed as hex numbers.
 For this purpose, we use 
\family typewriter
nasm
\family default
 assembler to write a few line of assembly code and see the generated code.

\begin_layout Example
Suppose we want to see the machine code generated for this instruction:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
jmp eax
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, we use an editor e.g.
 Emacs, then create a new file, write the code and save it in a file, e.g.
 
\family typewriter
test.asm
\family default
.
 Then, in the terminal, run the command: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

-f
\family default
 option specifies the file format, e.g.
 ELF, of the final output file.
 But in this case, the format is 
\family typewriter
bin
\family default
, which means this file is just a flat binary output without any extra informati
on.
 That is, the written assembly code is translated to machine code as is,
 without the overhead of the metadata from file format like ELF.
 Indeed, after compiling, we can examine the output using this command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\family typewriter
hd
\family default
 (short for hexdump) is a program that displays the content of a file in
 hex format
\begin_inset Marginal

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Though its name is short for hexdump, 
\family typewriter
hd 
\family default
can display in different base, e.g.
 binary, other than hex.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.

\family typewriter
 
\family default
And get the following output:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file only consists of 3 bytes: 
\family typewriter

66 ff e0

Recall that an assembly instruction is simply a fixed-size series of bits.
 The length of an instruction varies and depends on how complicated an instructi
on is.
 What every instruction shares is a common format described in the figure
 above that divides the bits of an instruction into smaller parts that encode
 different types of information.
 These parts are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
Instruction
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Prefixes
\family default
 appears at the beginning of an instruction.
 Prefixes are optional.
 A programmer can choose to use a prefix or not because in practice, a so-called
 prefix is just another assembly instruction to be inserted before another
 assembly instruction that such prefix is applicable.
 Instructions with 2 or 3-bytes opcodes include the prefixes by default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
Opcode
\family default
 is a unique number that identifies an instruction.
 Each opcode is given an mnemonic name that is human readable, e.g.
 one of the opcodes for instruction 
\family typewriter
add 
\family default
is 
\family typewriter
04
\family default
.
 When a CPU sees the number 
\family typewriter
04
\family default
 in its instruction cache, it sees instruction 
\family typewriter
add 
\family default
and execute accordingly.
 Opcode can be 1,2 or 3 bytes long and includes an additional 3-bit field
 in the 
\family typewriter
ModR/M
\family default
 byte when needed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an instruction, next to the opcode is a 
\family typewriter
ModR/M
\family default
 byte.
 Then, look up the byte value in this table to get the corresponding operands
 in the row and column.

\begin_layout Example
An instruction uses this addressing mode:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
jmp [0x1234]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
Then, the machine code is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

 34 12
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent

\family typewriter
0xff
\family default

 Next to it, 
\family typewriter
\color red
0x26
\family default
\color inherit
 is the 
\family typewriter
ModR/M
\family default
 byte.
 Look up in the 16-bit table 
\begin_inset Marginal
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Remember, using 
\family typewriter
bin 
\family default
format generates 16-bit code by default
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the first operand is in the row, equivalent to a 
\family typewriter
disp16
\family default
, which means a 16-bit offset.
 Since the instruction does not have a second operand, the column can be
 ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
An instruction uses this addressing mode:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
add eax, ecx
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
Then the machine code is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\color red
c8
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left

 Next to it, 
\family typewriter
\color red
c8
\color inherit
 
\family default
is the
\family typewriter
 ModR/M 
\family default
byte.
 Look up in the 16-bit table at 
\family typewriter
\color red

 value, the row tells the first operand is

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Remember, using bin format generates 16-bit code by default

, the column tells the second operand is 
\family typewriter
cx
\family default
; the column can't be ignored as the second operand is in the instruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is the first operand in the row and the second in a column? Let's break
 down the

 byte.
 This byte encodes ways to calculate the memory position into an element
 of an array.
 SIB is the name that is based on this formula for calculating an effective
 address:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{Effective\,address=scale*index+base}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Index
\family default
 is an offset into an array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Scale
\family default
 is a factor of 
\family typewriter
Index
\family default
.
 
\family typewriter
Scale
\family default
 is one of the values 1, 2, 4 or 8; any other value is invalid.
 To scale with values other than 2, 4 or 8, the scale factor must be set
 to 1, and the offset must be calculated manually.
 For example, if we want to get the address of the 
\family typewriter
n
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\family typewriter
th
\end_layout

\end_inset


\family default
 element in an array and each element is 
\family typewriter
12
\family default
-bytes long.
 Because each element is 12-bytes long instead of 1, 2, 4 or 8, 
\family typewriter
Scale
\family default
 is set to 1 and a compiler needs to calculate the offset:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{Effective\,address=1*(12*n)+base}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why do we bother with SIB when we can manually calculate the offset? The
 answer is that in the above scenario, an additional 
\family typewriter
mul
\family default
 instruction must be executed to get the offset, and the 
\family typewriter
mul 
\family default
instruction consumes more than 1 byte, while the SIB only consumes 1 byte.
 More importantly, if the element is repeatedly accessed many times in a
 loop, e.g.
 millions of times, then an extra 
\family typewriter
mul
\family default
 instruction can detriment the performance as the CPU must spend time executing
 millions of these additional 
\family typewriter
mul
\family default
 instructions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The values 2, 4 and 8 are not random chosen.
 They map to 16-bit (or 2 bytes), 32-bit (or 4 bytes) and 64-bit (or 8 bytes)
 numbers that are often used for intensive numeric calculations.

This instruction:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
jmp [eax*2 + ebx]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
generates the following code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
00000000  67 ff 24 
\color red
43
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, the first byte, 
\family typewriter
0x67
\family default
 is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 an opcode but a 
\emph on
prefix
\emph default
.
 The number is a predefined prefix for address-size override prefix.
 After the prefix, comes the opcode 
\family typewriter
0xff 
\family default
and the 
\family typewriter
ModR/M 
\family default
byte 
\family typewriter
0x24
\family default
.
 The value from 
\family typewriter
ModR/M
\family default
 suggests that there exists a 
\family typewriter
SIB
\family default
 byte that follows.
 The 
\family typewriter
SIB
\family default
 byte is 
\family typewriter
\color red

\family default
\color inherit
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
34 12
\family default
 in raw machine code, is the displacement and stands right next to 
\family typewriter
0x26
\family default
, which is the 
\family typewriter
ModR/M 
\family default
byte.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
This instruction:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
jmp [eax * 4  + 
\color red
0x1234
\color inherit
]
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
generates the machine code:

\color red
34 12 00 00
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
0x67
\family default
 is an address-size override prefix.
 Its meaning is that if an instruction runs a default address size e.g.
 16-bit, the use of prefix enables the instruction to use non-default address
 size, e.g.
 32-bit or 64-bit.
 Since the binary is supposed to be 16-bit, 
\family typewriter
0x67
\family default
 changes the instruction to 32-bit mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
0xff
\family default
 is the opcode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
0x24
\family default
 is the 
\family typewriter
ModR/M
\family default
 byte.
 The value suggests that a SIB byte follows, according to table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "mod-rm-32"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
\color red
34 12 00 00
\color inherit
 
\family default
is the displacement.
 As can be seen, the displacement is 4 bytes in size, which is equivalent
 to 32-bit, due to address-size override prefix.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
Immediate 
\family default
When an instruction accepts a fixed value, e.g.
 
\family typewriter
0x1234
\family default
, as an operand, this optional field holds the value.
 Note that this field is different from displacement: the value is not necessary
 used an offset, but an arbitrary value of anything.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Example
This instruction:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
mov eax, 
\color red
0x1234
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
generates the code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
66 b8 34 12 00 00
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
0x66
\family default
 is operand-sized override prefix.
 Similar to address-size override prefix, this prefix enables operand-size
 to be non-default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
0xb8
\family default
 is one of the opcodes for 
\family typewriter
mov
\family default
 instruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
0x1234 
\family default
is the value to be stored in register 
\family typewriter
eax
\family default
.
 It is just a value for storing directly into a register, and nothing more.
 On the other hand, displacement value is an offset for some address calculation.

\family typewriter
Opcode 
\family default
shows
\family typewriter
 
\family default
a unique hexadecimal number assigned to an instruction.
 There can be more than one opcode for an instruction, each encodes a variant
 of the instruction.
 For example, one variant requires one operand, but another requires two.
 In this column, there can be other notations aside from hexadecimal numbers.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
/r 
\family default
indicates that the 
\family typewriter
ModR/M
\family default
 byte of the instruction contains a 
\family typewriter
reg
\family default
 operand and an 
\family typewriter
r/m
\family default
 operand.
 The detail listing is in section 
\emph on
3.1.1.1

 and 
\emph on
3.1.1.2
\emph default
 in the Intel's manual, volume 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
Instruction
\family default
 gives the syntax of the assembly instruction that a programmer can use
 for writing code.
 Aside from the mnemonic representation of the opcode, e.g.
 
\family typewriter
jmp
\family default
, other symbols represent operands with specific properties in the instruction.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
rel8 
\family default
represents a relative address from 128 bytes before the end of the instruction
 to 127 bytes after the end of instruction; similarly 
\family typewriter
rel16/rel32 
\family default
also represents relative addresses, but with the operand size of 16/32-bit
 instead of 8-bit like 
\family typewriter
rel8
\family default
.
 For a detailed listing, please refer to section
\family typewriter

Most instructions require one to two operands.
 We make use of these instructions for our OS and skip the instructions
 that require three or four operands.
 The operands can be readable or writable or both.
 The symbol 
\family typewriter
(r)
\family default
 denotes a readable operand, and 
\family typewriter
(w)
\family default
 denotes a writable operand.
 For example, when 
\family typewriter
Operand 1
\family default
 field contains 
\family typewriter
ModRM:r/m (r)
\family default
, it means the first operand is encoded in 
\family typewriter

Each row lists a variant of 
\family typewriter
jmp
\family default
 instruction.
 The first column has the opcode 
\family typewriter
EB cb
\family default
, with an equivalent symbolic form 
\family typewriter
jmp rel8
\family default
.
 Here, 
\family typewriter
rel8
\family default
 means 128 bytes offset, counting from the end of the instruction.
 The end of an instruction is the next byte after the last byte of an instructio
n.
 To make it more concrete, consider this assembly code:
\end_layout

The first 
\family typewriter
\color red
jmp main
\family default
\color inherit
 instruction is generated into 
\family typewriter
\color red
eb fe
\family default
\color inherit
 and occupies the addresses 
\family typewriter
00
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
01
\family default
; the end of the first 
\family typewriter
\color red
jmp main
\family default
\color inherit
 is at address 
\family typewriter
\color magenta
02
\family default
\color inherit
, past the last byte of the first 
\family typewriter
\color red
jmp main
\family default
\color inherit
 which is located at the address 
\family typewriter
01
\family default
.
 The value 
\family typewriter
\color red
fe
\color inherit
 
\family default
is equivalent to 
\family typewriter
-2
\family default
, since 
\family typewriter
\color red
eb
\family default
\color inherit
 opcode uses only a byte (8 bits) for relative addressing.
 The offset is 
\family typewriter
-2
\family default
, and the end address of the first 
\family typewriter
\color red
jmp main
\family default
\color inherit
 is 
\family typewriter
02
\family default
, adding them together we get 
\family typewriter
00
\family default
 which is the destination address for jumping to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
Similarly, the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
jmp main2
\family default
\color inherit
 instruction is generated into 
\family typewriter
\color blue
eb 02
\family default
\color inherit
, which means the offset is 
\family typewriter
+2
\family default
; the end address of 
\family typewriter
\color blue
jmp main2
\family default
\color inherit
 is at 
\family typewriter
\color magenta
04
\family default
\color inherit
, and adding together with the offset we get the destination address is
 
\family typewriter
06
\family default
, which is the start instruction marked by the label 
\family typewriter
main2
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same rule can be applied to 
\family typewriter
rel16 
\family default
and 
\family typewriter
rel32 
\family default
encoding.
 In the example code, 
\family typewriter
\color green
jmp 0x1234
\color inherit
 
\family default
uses 
\family typewriter
rel16
\family default
 (which means 2-byte offset) and is generated into 
\family typewriter
\color green
e9 2b 12
\family default
\color inherit
.
 As the table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "jmp-instruction"

\end_inset

 shows, 
\family typewriter
e9
\family default
 opcode takes a 
\family typewriter
cw
\family default
 operand, which is a 2-byte offset (section 
\emph on
3.1.1.1
\emph default
, volume 2).
 Notice one strange issue here: the offset value is 
\family typewriter
\color green
2b 12
\family default
\color inherit
, while it is supposed to be 
\family typewriter
34 12
\family default
.
 There is nothing wrong.
 Remember, 
\family typewriter
rel8/rel16/rel32 
\family default
is an 
\emph on
offset
\emph default
, not an 
\emph on
address
\emph default
.
 A offset is a distance from a point.
 Since no label is given but a number, the offset is calculated from the
 start of a program.
 In this case, the start of the program is the address 
\family typewriter
00
\family default
, the end of 
\family typewriter
\color green
jmp 0x1234
\family default
 
\color inherit
is the address 
\family typewriter
\color magenta
09
\family default
\color inherit

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
which means 9 bytes was consumed, starting from address 0.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, so the offset is calculated as 
\family typewriter
0x1234 - 0x9 = 0x122b
\family default
.
 That solved the mystery!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
jmp
\family default
 instructions with opcode 
\family typewriter
FF /4
\family default
 enable jumping to a 
\emph on
near, absolute 
\emph default
address stored in a general-purpose register or a memory location; or in
 short, as written in the description, 
\emph on
absolute indirect
\emph default
.
 The symbol 
\family typewriter

\family default
 is the column with digit 4 in table

\color blue

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\align left
Since this is 16-bit code, we use table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "mod-rm-16"

\end_inset

.
 Looking up the table, 
\family typewriter
ModR/M
\family default
 value 
\family typewriter
26 
\family default
means 
\family typewriter
disp16
\family default
, which means a 16-bit offset from the start of current index
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Look at the note under the table.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which is the base address stored in 
\family typewriter
DS
\family default
 register.
 In this case, 
\family typewriter
jmp [0x1234] 
\family default
is implicitly understood as 
\family typewriter
jmp [ds:
\color blue
0x1234
\color inherit
]
\family default
, which means the destination address is 
\family typewriter
0x1234
\family default
 bytes away from the start of a data segment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
jmp
\family default
 instruction with opcode 
\family typewriter
FF /5
\family default
 enables jumping to a 
\emph on
far, absolute
\emph default
 address stored in a 
\emph on
memory location
\emph default
 (as opposed to 
\family typewriter
/4
\family default
, which means stored in a register); in short, 
\emph on
a far pointer
\emph default
.
 To generate such instruction, the keyword 
\family typewriter
far
\family default
 is needed to tell 
\family typewriter
nasm
\family default
 we are using a far pointer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
jmp 
\color red
far
\color inherit
 [eax]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
67 ff 
\color red
28
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
Since 
\family typewriter
\color red

\family default
\color inherit
 is the value in the 5th column of the table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Remember the prefix 
\family typewriter
67
\family default
 indicates the instruction is used as 32-bit.
 The prefix only added if the default environment is assumed as 16-bit when
 generating code by an assembler.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 that refers to 
\family typewriter
[eax]
\family default
, we successfully generate an instruction for a far jump.
 After CPU runs the instruction, the program counter 
\family typewriter
eip
\family default
 and code segment register 
\family typewriter
cs 
\family default
is set to the memory address, stored in the memory location that 
\family typewriter
eax
\family default
 points to, and CPU starts fetching code from the new address in 
\family typewriter
cs 
\family default
and 
\family typewriter

The far address consumes total of 6 bytes in size for a 16-bit segment and

\family default

\family default
\color inherit
 and start executing from there.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the 
\family typewriter
jmp
\family default
 instructions with 
\family typewriter
EA
\family default
 opcode jump to a direct absolute address.
 For example, the instruction:
\end_layout

\color red
0x1234

\color blue

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The address 
\family typewriter
\color blue
0x5678

In this section, we will examine how data definition in C maps to its assembly
 form.
 The generated code is extracted from

 That means, the assembly code displayed has no

Actually, code is just a type of data, and is often used for hijacking into
 a running program to execute such code.
 However, we have no use for it in this book.

 The chapter lists fundamental data types that x86 hardware operates on,
 and through learning the generated assembly code, it can be understood
 how close C maps its syntax to hardware, and then a programmer can see
 why C is appropriate for OS programming.

Fundamental data types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most basic types that x86 architecture works with are based on sizes,
 each is twice as large as the previous one: 1 byte (8 bits), 2 bytes (16
 bits), 4 bytes (32 bits), 8 bytes (64 bits) and 16 bytes (128 bits).

These types are simplest: they are just chunks of memory at different sizes
 that enables CPU to access memory efficiently.
 From the manual, 
\emph on
section 4.1.1
\emph default
, volume 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Words, doublewords, and quadwords do not need to be aligned in memory on
 natural boundaries.
 The natural boundaries for words, double words, and quadwords are even-numbered
 addresses, addresses evenly divisible by four, and addresses evenly divisible
 by eight, respectively.
 However, to improve the performance of programs, data structures (especially
 stacks) should be aligned on natural boundaries whenever possible.
 The reason for this is that the processor requires two memory accesses
 to make an unaligned memory access; aligned accesses require only one memory
 access.
 A word or doubleword operand that crosses a 4-byte boundary or a quadword
 operand that crosses an 8-byte boundary is considered unaligned and requires
 two separate memory bus cycles for access.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Some instructions that operate on double quadwords require memory operands
 to be aligned on a natural boundary.
 These instructions generate a general-protection exception (
\family typewriter
#GP
\family default
) if an unaligned operand is specified.
 A natural boundary for a double quadword is any address evenly divisible
 by 16.
 Other instructions that operate on double quadwords permit unaligned access
 (without generating a general-protection exception).
 However, additional memory bus cycles are required to access unaligned
 data from memory.

the assembly listing carries no meaning.

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen in the 
\family typewriter
readelf
\family default
 output, variables are allocated storage space according to their types
 and in the declared order by the programmer (the colors correspond the
 the variables).
 Intel is a little-endian machine, which means smaller addresses hold bytes
 with smaller values, larger addresses hold byte with larger values.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
0x1234
\family default
 is displayed as 
\family typewriter
34 12
\family default
; that is, 
\family typewriter
34
\family default
 appears first at address 
\family typewriter
0x601032
\family default
, then 
\family typewriter
12
\family default
 at 
\family typewriter
0x601033
\family default
.
 The decimal values within a byte is unchanged, so we see 
\family typewriter
34
\family default
 
\family typewriter
12
\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
43 21
\family default
.
 This is quite confusing at first, but you will get used to it soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Also, isn't it redundant when 
\family typewriter
char
\family default
 type is always 1 byte already and why do we bother adding 
\family typewriter
int8_t
\family default
? The truth is, 
\family typewriter
char
\family default
 type is not guaranteed to be 1 byte in size, but only the minimum of 1
 byte in size.
 In C, a byte is defined to be the size of a char, and a char is defined
 to be smallest addressable unit of the underlying hardware platform.
 There are hardware devices that the smallest addressable unit is 16 bit
 or even bigger, which means char is 2 bytes in size and a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

byte
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in such platforms is actually 2 units of 8-bit bytes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all architectures support the double quadword type.
 Still, 
\family typewriter
gcc 
\family default
does provide support for 128-bit number and generate code when a CPU supports
 it (that is, a CPU must be 64-bit).
 By specifying a variable of type 
\family typewriter
__int128
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
unsigned __int128
\family default
, we get a 128-bit variable.
 If a CPU does not support 64-bit mode, 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 throws an error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data types in C, which represents the fundamental data types, are also
 called 
\emph on
unsigned numbers
\emph default
.
 Other than numerical calculations, unsigned numbers are used as a tool
 for structuring data in memory; we will this application see later in the
 book, when various data structures are organized into bit groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all the examples above, when the value of a variable with smaller size
 is assigned to a variable with larger size, the value easily fits in the
 larger variable.
 On the contrary, the value of a variable with larger size is assigned to
 a variable with smaller size, two scenarios occur: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The value is greater than the maximum value of the variable with smaller
 layout, so it needs truncating to the size of the variable and causing
 incorrect value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The value is smaller than the maximum value of the variable with a smaller
 layout, so it fits the variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the value might be unknown until runtime and can be value, it is
 best not to let such implicit conversion handled by the compiler, but explicitl
y controlled by a programmer.
 Otherwise it will cause subtle bugs that are hard to catch as the erroneous
 values might rarely be used to reproduce the bugs.

\begin_layout Subsection
Pointer Data Types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pointers are variables that hold memory addresses.
 x86 works with 2 types of pointers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Near
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

pointer is a 16-bit/32-bit offset within a segment, also called 
\emph on
effective address
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Far
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

pointer is also an offset like a near pointer, but with an explicit segment
 selector.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
C only provides near pointer, since far pointer is platform dependent, such
 as x86.
 In application code, you can assume that the address of current segment
 starts at 0, so the offset is actually any memory addres from 0 to the
 maximum address.

 is a contiguous sequence of bits.
 Bit fields allow data structuring at bit level.
 For example, a 32-bit data can hold multiple bit fields that represent
 multiples different pieces of information, such as bits 0-4 specifies the
 size of a data structure, bit 5-6 specifies permissions and so on.
 Data structures at the bit level are common for low-level programming.

\begin_layout Standard
The sample code creates 4 variables: 
\family typewriter
\color red
ns
\family default
\color inherit
, 
\family typewriter
\color blue
i
\family default
\color inherit
, 
\family typewriter
\color magenta
bf
\family default
\color inherit
, 
\family typewriter
\color green
bf2
\family default
\color inherit
.
 The definition of 
\family typewriter
normal_struct
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
bit_field
\family default
 structs both specify 4 integers.

\family typewriter
 bit_field
\family default
 specifies additional information next to its member name, separated by
 a colon, e.g.
 
\family typewriter
.data1 : 8
\family default
.
 This extra information is the bit width of each bit group.
 It means, even though defined as an 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
.data1
\family default
 only consumes 8 bit of information.
 If additional data members are specified after 
\family typewriter
.data1
\family default
, two scenarios happen:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the new data members fit within the remaining bits after 
\family typewriter
.data
\family default
, which are 24 bits
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since .data1 is declared as an int, 32 bits are still allocated, but 
\family typewriter
.data1 
\family default
can only access 8 bits of information.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, then the total size of 
\family typewriter
bit_field
\family default
 struct is still 4 bytes, or 32 bits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the new data members don't fit, then the remaining 24 bits (3 bytes)
 are still allocated.
 However, the new data members are allocated brand new storages, without
 using the previous 24 bits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the example, the 4 data members: 
\family typewriter
.data1
\family default
,
\family typewriter
 .data2
\family default
,
\family typewriter
 .data3
\family default
 and
\family typewriter
 .data4
\family default
, each can access 8 bits of information, and together can access all of
 4 bytes of the integer first declared by 
\family typewriter
.data1
\family default
.
 As can be seen by the generated assembly code, the values of 
\family typewriter
bf
\family default
 are follow natural order as written in the C code: 
\family typewriter
\color red
12 34 56 78
\family default
\color inherit
, since each value is a separate members.
 In contrast, the value of 
\family typewriter
i
\family default
 is a number as a whole, so it is subject to the rule of little endianess
 and thus contains the value 
\family typewriter
\color blue
78
\family default
 
\family typewriter
56 34 12
\family default
\color inherit
.
 Note that at 
\family typewriter
\color magenta
804a02f
\family default
\color inherit
, is the address of the final byte in
\color magenta
 
\family typewriter
bf
\family default
\color inherit
, but next to it is a number 
\family typewriter
12
\family default
, despite 
\family typewriter
78
\family default
 is the last number in it.
 This extra number 
\family typewriter
12
\family default
 does not belong to the value of 
\family typewriter
\color magenta
bf
\family default
\color inherit
.
 
\family typewriter
objdump
\family default
 is just being confused that 
\family typewriter
78
\family default
 is an opcode; 
\family typewriter
78
\family default
 corresponds to 
\family typewriter
js
\family default
 instruction, and it requires an operand.
 For that reason, 
\family typewriter
objdump
\family default
 grabs whatever the next byte after 78 and put it there.
 
\family typewriter
objdump
\family default
 is a tool to display assembly code after all.
 A better tool to use is 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 that we will learn in the next chapter.
 But for this chapter, 
\family typewriter
objdump
\family default
 suffices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike 
\family typewriter
bf
\family default
, each data member in 
\family typewriter
ns
\family default
 is allocated fully as an integer, 4 bytes each, 16 bytes in total.
 As we can see, bit field and normal struct are different: bit field structure
 data at the bit level, while normal struct works at byte level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the struct of 
\family typewriter
\color green
bf2
\color inherit

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
bit_field2
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\family default
is the same of 
\family typewriter
\color magenta
bf
\family default
\color inherit

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
bit_field
\end_layout

\end_inset

, except it contains one more data member: 
\family typewriter
.data5
\family default
, and is defined as an integer.
 For this reason, another 4 bytes are allocated just for 
\family typewriter
.data5
\family default
, even though it can only access 8 bits of information, and the final value
 of 
\family typewriter
\color green
bf2
\family default
\color inherit
 is: 
\family typewriter
\color green
12 34 56 78 0f 00 00 00
\family default
\color inherit
.
 The remaining 3 bytes must be accessed by the mean of a pointer, or casting
 to another data type that can fully access all 4 bytes..

String Data Types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although share the same name, string as defined by x86 is different than
 a string in C.
 x86 defines string as 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continuous sequences of bits, bytes, words, or doublewords
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 On the other hand, C defines a string as an array of 1-byte characters
 with a zero as the last element of the array to make a 
\emph on
null-terminated string
\emph default
.
 This implies that strings in x86 are arrays, not C strings.
 A programmer can define an array of bytes, words or doublewords with 
\family typewriter
char
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
uint8_t
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
short
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
uint16_t
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
uint32_t
\family default
, except an array of bits.
 However, such a feature can be easily implemented, as an array of bits
 is essentially any array of bytes, or words or doublewords, but operates
 at the bit level.

\begin_layout Standard
Despite 
\family typewriter
\color red
a8
\family default
\color inherit
 is an array with 2 elements, each is 1-byte long, but it is still allocated
 with 4 bytes.
 Again, to ensure natural alignment for best performance, 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 pads extra zero bytes.
 As shown in the assembly listing, the actual value of 
\family typewriter
\color red
a8
\family default
\color inherit
 is 
\family typewriter
12 34 00 00
\family default
, with 
\family typewriter
\color red
a8
\color inherit
[0]
\family default
 equals to 
\family typewriter
12
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
\color red
a8
\color inherit
[1]
\family default
 equals to 
\family typewriter
34
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then it comes 
\family typewriter
\color blue
a16
\family default
\color inherit
 with 2 elements, each is 2-byte long.
 Since 2 elements are 4 bytes in total, which is in the natural alignment,
 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 pads no byte.
 The value of 
\family typewriter
\color blue
a16
\family default
\color inherit
 is 
\family typewriter
34 12 78 56
\family default
, with 
\family typewriter
\color blue
a16
\color inherit
[0]
\family default
 equals to 
\family typewriter
34 12
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
\color blue
a16
\color inherit
[1]
\family default
 equals to 
\family typewriter
78 56
\family default
.
 Note that, objdump is confused again, as 
\family typewriter
de
\family default
 is the opcode for the instruction 
\family typewriter
fidivr
\family default
 (short of reverse divide) that requires another operand, so 
\family typewriter
objdump
\family default
 grabs whatever the next bytes that makes sense to it for creating 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

an operand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Only the highlighted values belong to 
\family typewriter
\color magenta
a32
\family default
\color inherit
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next is 
\family typewriter
\color magenta
a32
\family default
\color inherit
, with 2 elements, 4 bytes each.
 Similar to above arrays, the value of 
\family typewriter
\color magenta
a32
\color inherit
[0]
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
78 56 34 12
\family default
, the value of 
\family typewriter
\color magenta
a32
\color inherit
[1]
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
f0 de bc 9a
\family default
, exactly what is assigned in the C code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally is 
\family typewriter
\color green
a64
\family default
\color inherit
, also with 2 elements, but 8 bytes each.
 The total size of 
\family typewriter
\color green
a64
\family default
\color inherit
 is 16 bytes, which is in the natural alignment, therefore no padding bytes
 added.
 The values of both 
\family typewriter
\color green
a64
\color inherit
[0]
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
\color green
a64
\color inherit
[1]
\family default
 are the same: 
\family typewriter
f0 de bc 9a 78 56 34 12
\family default
, that got misinterpreted to 
\family typewriter
fidivr
\family default
 instruction.

Technically, multi-dimensional arrays are like normal arrays: in the end,
 the total size is translated into flat allocated bytes.
 A 2 x 2 array is allocated with 4 bytes; a 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2\times2$
\end_inset

 array is allocated with 8 bytes, as can be seen in the assembly listing
 of 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Again, 
\family typewriter
objdump
\family default
 is confused and put the number 
\family typewriter
12
\family default
 next to 78 in 
\family typewriter
a3
\family default
 listing.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
\color blue
a3
\family default
\color inherit
.
 In low-level assembly code, the representation is the same between 
\family typewriter
a[4]
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
a[2][2]
\family default
.
 However, in high-level C code, the difference is tremendous.
 The syntax of multi-dimensional array enables a programmer to think with
 higher level concepts, instead of translating manually from high-level
 concepts to low-level code and work with high-level concepts in his head
 at the same time.

\begin_layout Standard
To access a name, we simply adjust the column index

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The left index is called column index since it changes the index based on
 a column.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 e.g.
 
\family typewriter
names[0]

, 
\family typewriter

.
 To access individual character within a name, we use the row index

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Same with column index, the right index is called row index since it changes
 the index based on a row.
\end_layout

\family typewriter

\begin_layout Standard
Without such syntax, we need to create a 20-byte array e.g.
 
\family typewriter
names[20]
\family default
, and whenever we want to access a character e.g.
 to check if the names contains with a number in it, we need to calculate
 the index manually.
 It would be distracting, since we constantly need to switch thinkings between
 the actual problem and the translate problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since this is a repeating pattern, C abstracts away this problem with the
 syntax for define and manipulating multi-dimensional array.
 Through this example, we can clearly see the power of abstraction through
 language can give us.
 It would be ideal if a programmer is equipped with such power to define
 whatever syntax suitable for a problem at hands.
 Not many languages provide such capacity.
 Fortunately, through C macro, we can partially achieve that goal .

Data Transfer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous section explores how various types of data are created, and how
 they are laid out in memory.
 Once memory storages are allocated for variables, they must be accessible
 and writable.
 Data transfer instructions move data (bytes, words, doublewords or quadwords)
 between memory and registers, and between registers, effectively read from
 a storage source and write to another storage source.

\begin_layout Itemize
the expression only costs 3 instructions instead of 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This prefix-increment syntax is faster than the post-fix one used previously.
 It might not matter much which version to use if the increment is only
 used once or a few hundred times in a small loop, but it matters when a
 loop runs millions or more times.
 Also, depends on different circumstances, it is more convenient to use
 one over the other e.g.
 if 
\family typewriter
i
\family default
 is an index for accessing an array, we want to use the old value for accessing
 previous array element and newly incremented 
\family typewriter
i
\family default
 for current element.

Stack
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A stack is a contiguous array of memory locations that holds a collection
 of discrete data.
 When a new element is added, a stack 
\emph on
grows down
\emph default
 in memory toward lesser addresses, and 
\emph on
shrinks up
\emph default
 toward greater addresses when an element is removed.
 x86 uses the 
\family typewriter
esp
\family default
 register to point to the top of the stack, at the newest element.
 A stack can be originated anywhere in main memory, as 
\family typewriter
esp
\family default
 can be set to any memory address.
 x86 provides two operations for manipulating stacks:
\family typewriter
 
\end_layout

Automatic variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Local variables are variables that exist within a scope.
 A scope is delimited by a pair of braces: 
\family typewriter
{..}
\family default
.
 The most common scope to define local variables is at function scope.
 However, scope can be unnamed, and variables created inside an unnamed
 scope do not exist outside of its scope and its inner scope.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Function scope:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

void foo() {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    int a;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    int b;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
a
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
b
\family default
 are variables local to the function 
\family typewriter
foo
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout --Separator--

\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Unnamed scope:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

int foo() {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    int i;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

        int a = 1;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

        int b = 2;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

        {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

            return i = a + b;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

        }

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
a
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
b
\family default
 are local to where it is defined and local into its inner child scope that
 return 
\family typewriter
i = a + b
\family default
.
 However, they do not exist at the function scope that creates 
\family typewriter
i
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
When a local variable is created, it is pushed on the stack; when a local
 variable goes out of scope, it is pop out of the stack, thus destroyed.
 When an argument is passed from a caller to a callee, it is pushed on the
 stack; when a callee returns to the caller, the arguments are popped out
 the stack.
 The local variables and arguments are automatically allocated upon enter
 a function and destroyed after exiting a function, that's why it's called
 
\emph on
automatic variables
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A base frame pointer points to the start of the current function frame,
 and is kept in 
\family typewriter
ebp 
\family default
register.
 Whenever a function is called, it is allocated with its own dedicated storage
 on stack, called 
\emph on
stack frame
\emph default
.
 A stack frame is where all local variables and arguments of a function
 are placed on a stack
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Data and only data are exclusively allocated on stack for every stack frame.
 No code resides here.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a function needs a local variable or an argument, it uses 
\family typewriter
ebp
\family default
 to access a variable:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All local variables are allocated after the 
\family typewriter
ebp
\family default
 pointer.
 Thus, to access a local variable, a number is subtracted from 
\family typewriter
ebp
\family default
 to reach the location of the variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All arguments are allocated before 
\family typewriter
ebp
\family default
 pointer.
 To access an argument, a number is added to 
\family typewriter
ebp
\family default
 to reach the location of the argument.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
ebp
\family default
 itself pointer points to the return address of its caller.

\begin_layout Standard
In the assembly listing, 
\family typewriter
\color blue
[ebp-0x4]
\family default
\color inherit
 is the local variable 
\family typewriter
\color blue
i
\family default
\color inherit
, since it is allocated 
\emph on
after 
\family typewriter
\emph default
ebp
\family default
, with the length of 4 bytes (an 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
).
 On the other hand,
\family typewriter
 
\color red
a
\family default
\color inherit
 and 
\family typewriter
\color green
b
\family default
\color inherit
 are arguments and can be accessed with 
\family typewriter
ebp
\family default
: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
\color red
[ebp+0x8]
\color inherit
 
\family default
accesses 
\family typewriter
\color red
a
\family default
\color inherit
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
\color green
[ebp+0xc]
\family default
\color inherit
 access 
\family typewriter
\color green
b
\family default
\color inherit
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For accessing arguments, the rule is that the closer a variable on stack
 to 
\family typewriter
ebp
\family default
, the closer it is to a function name.

For every function call, 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 pushes arguments on the stack in reversed order with the 
\family typewriter
\color red
push
\family default
\color inherit
 instructions.
 That is, the arguments pushed on stack are in reserved order as it is written
 in high level C code, to ensure the relative order between arguments, as
 seen in previous section how function arguments and local variables are
 laid out.
 Then, 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 generates a 
\family typewriter
\color blue
call
\family default
\color inherit
 instruction, which then implicitly pushes a return address before transferring
 the control to 
\family typewriter
add
\family default

Upon finishing the call to 
\family typewriter
add
\family default
 function, the stack is restored by adding 
\family typewriter
0x8
\family default
 to stack pointer 
\family typewriter
esp 
\family default
(which is equivalent to 2 
\family typewriter
pop
\family default
 instructions).
 Finally, a 
\family typewriter
leave
\family default
 instruction is executed and main returns with a 
\family typewriter
ret
\family default
 instruction.
 A 
\family typewriter
ret
\family default
 instruction transfers the program execution back to the caller to the instructi
on right after the 
\family typewriter
call
\family default
 instruction, the 
\family typewriter
add
\family default
 instruction.
 The reason 
\family typewriter
ret
\family default
 can return to such location is that the return address implicitly pushed
 by the 
\family typewriter
call
\family default
 instruction, which is the address right after the 
\family typewriter
call
\family default
 instruction; whenever the CPU executes 
\family typewriter
ret
\family default
 instruction, it retrieves the return address that sits right after all
 the arguments on the stack:

\begin_layout Standard
At the end of a function, 
\family typewriter
gcc 
\family default
places a 
\family typewriter
leave
\family default
 instruction to clean up all spaces allocated for local variables and restore
 the frame pointer to frame pointer of the caller.

\begin_layout Standard
Every program consists of code and data, and only those two components made
 up a program.
 However, if a program consists purely code and data of its own, from the
 perspective of an operating system (as well as human), it does not know
 in a program, which block of binary is a program and which is just raw
 data, where in the program to start execution, which region of memory should
 be protected and which is free to modify.
 For that reason, each program carries extra metadata to communicate with
 the operating system how to handle the program.

Later we will compile our kernel as an ELF executable with GCC, and explicitly
 specify how segments are created and where they are loaded in memory through
 the use a 
\emph on
linker script
\emph default
, a text file to instruct how a linker should generate a binary.
 For now, we will examine the anatomy of an ELF executable in detail.

It is a useful resource to understand and implement ELF.
 However, it will be much easier to use after you finish this chapter, as
 the specification mixes implementation details in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default specification is a generic one, in which every ELF implementation
 follows.
 However, each platform provides extra features unique to it.
 The ELF specification for x86 is currently maintained on Github by H.J.

\begin_layout Standard
As we know already, code and data compose a program.
 However, not all types of code and data have the same purpose.
 For that reason, instead of a big chunk of code and data, they are divided
 into smaller chunks, and each chunk must satisfy these conditions (according
 to gABI):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every section in an object file has exactly one section header describing
 it.
 But, section headers may exist that do not have a section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each section occupies one contiguous (possibly empty) sequence of bytes
 within a file.
 That means, there's no two regions of bytes that are the same section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sections in a file may not overlap.
 No byte in a file resides in more than one section.

An object file may have inactive space.
 The various headers and the sections might not

 The contents of the inactive data are unspecified.

 Some sections hold a table of fixed-size entries, such as a symbol table.
 For such a section, this member gives the size in bytes of each entry.
 The member contains 0 if the section does not hold a table of fixed-size
 entries.

\end_inset


\emph on
 
\emph default
describes attributes of a section.
 Flags together with a type defines the purpose of a section.
 Two sections can be of the same type, but serve different purposes.
 For example, even though 
\family typewriter
.data
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 share the same type, 
\family typewriter
.data
\family default
 holds the initialized data of a program while 
\family typewriter
.text 
\family default
holds executable instructions of a program.
 For that reason, 
\family typewriter
.data
\family default
 is given read and write permission, but not executable.
 Any attempt to execute code in 
\family typewriter
.data
\family default
 is denied by the running OS: in Linux, such invalid section usage gives
 a 
\emph on
segmentation fault
\emph default
.

 It happens because the linking process can be done manually with a linker

Later when writing our OS, we will handcraft the kernel image by explicitly
 linking the object files (produced by 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
) through a linker script.
 We will specify the memory layout of sections by specifying at what addresses
 they will appear in the final image.
 But we will not assign any section flag and let the linker take care of
 it.
 Nevertheless, knowing which flag does what is useful.

...
 by looking at each section one by one.
 We will also examine the content of each section as a hexdump with the
 commands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

 (the

Other sections are mainly needed for dynamic linking, that is code linking
 at runtime for sharing between many programs.
 To enable such feature, an OS as a runtime environment must be presented.
 Since we run our OS on bare metal, we are effectively creating such environment.
 For simplicity, we won't add dynamic linking to our OS.

 are symbols whose definitions can be redefined.
 Normally, a symbol with multiple definitions are reported as an error by
 a compiler.
 However, this constraint is lax when a definition is explicitly marked
 as weak, which means the default implementation can be replaced by a different
 definition at link time.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Example
Suppose we have a default implementation of the function 
\family typewriter
add
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
function attribute
\end_layout

\end_inset

function attribute
\emph default
 is extra information for a compiler to handle a function differently from
 a normal function.
 In this example, 
\family typewriter
weak
\family default
 attribute makes the function 
\family typewriter
add 
\family default
a weak function,which means the default implementation can be replaced by
 a different definition at link time.
 Function attribute is a feature of a compiler, not standard C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we do not supply a different function definition in a different file
 (must be in a different file, otherwise 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 reports as an error), then the default implementation is applied.
 When the function 
\family typewriter
add
\family default
 is called, it only prints the message: 
\family typewriter
"warning: function not implemented"
\family default
and returns 0:
\end_layout

end{shellcommand}
\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
However, if we supply a different definition in another file e.g.
 
\family typewriter
math.c
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language=C,tabsize=4,title={\texttt{math.c}}"

int add(int a, int b) {

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    return a + b;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left

Then, when running

 when a better implementation is available (e.g.

 The first and last byte of this section is always a NULL character.
 A string table section exists because a string can be reused by more than
 one section to represent symbol and section names, so a program like 
\family typewriter
readelf
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
objdump
\family default
 can display various objects in a program, e.g.
 variable, functions, section names, in a human-readable text instead of
 its raw hex address.

\begin_layout Standard
The actual implementation of a string table is a contiguous array of null-termin
ated strings.
 The index of a string is the position of its first character in the array.
 For example, in the above string table, 
\family typewriter
.symtab
\family default
 is at index 1 in the array (NULL character is at index 0).
 The length of 
\family typewriter
.symtab
\family default
 is 7, plus the NULL character, which occurs 8 bytes in total.
 So, 
\family typewriter
.strtab 
\family default
starts at index 9, and so on.

In the above output, the 
\color red
size
\color inherit
 of the section is only 8 bytes, while the 
\color magenta
offsets
\color inherit
 of both sections are the same, which means 
\family typewriter
.bss
\family default
 consumes no byte of the executable binary on disk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the 
\family typewriter
.comment
\family default
 section has no starting address.
 This means that this section is discarded when the executable binary is
 loaded into memory.

INIT_ARRAY
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\family default
is an array of function pointers for program initialization.
 When an application program runs, before getting to
\family typewriter
 main()
\family default
, initialization code in 
\family typewriter
.init
\family default
 and this section are executed first.
 The first element in this array is an ignored function pointer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
It might not make sense when we can include initialization code in the 
\family typewriter
main()
\family default
 function.
 However, for shared object files where there are no 
\family typewriter
main()
\family default
, this section ensures that the initialization code from an object file
 executes before any other code to ensure a proper environment for main
 code to run properly.
 It also makes an object file more modularity, as the main application code
 needs not to be responsible for initializing a proper environment for using
 a particular object file, but the object file itself.
 Such a clear division makes code cleaner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Segments vs sections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned earlier, an operating system loads program segments, not sections.
 However, a question arises: Why doesn't the operating system use sections
 instead? After all, a section also contains similar information to a program
 segment, such as the type, the virtual memory address to be loaded, the
 size, the attributes, the flags and align.
 As explained before, a segment is the perspective of an operating system,
 while a section is the perspective of a linker.
 To understand why, looking into the structure of a segment, we can easily
 see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A segment is a collection of sections.
 It means that sections are logically grouped together by their attributes.
 For example, all sections in a 
\family typewriter
LOAD
\family default
 segment are always loaded by the operating system; all sections have the
 same permission, either a 
\family typewriter
RE 
\family default
(Read + Execute) for executable sections, or 
\family typewriter
RW
\family default
 (Read + Write) for data sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By grouping sections into a segment, it is easier for an operating system
 to batch load sections just once by loading the start and end of a segment,
 instead of loading section by section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since a segment is for loading a program and a section is for linking a
 program, all the sections in a segment is 
\emph on
within its start and end virtual memory addresses of a segment
\emph default

To see the last point clearer, consider an example of linking two object
 files.
 Suppose we have two source files:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language=C,showstringspaces=false,tabsize=4,title={\texttt{hello.c}}"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

#include <stdio.h>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    printf("Hello World
\backslash
n");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    return 0;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language=C,tabsize=4,title={\texttt{math.c}}"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

int add(int a, int b) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    return a + b;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, compile the two source files as 
\emph on
object files
\emph default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

Then, we check the sections of

As shown in the output, all the section virtual memory addresses of every
 section are set to 0.
 At this stage, each object file is simply a 
\emph on
block of binary
\emph default
 that contains code and data.
 Its existence is to serve as a material container for the final product,
 which is the executable binary.
 As such, the virtual addresses in 
\family typewriter

 are all zeroes.

\begin_layout Standard
Every loadable section is assigned an address, highlighted in 
\color green
green
\color inherit
.
 The reason each section got its own address is that in reality, 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 
\emph on
does not combine an object by itself, but invokes the linker
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
ld
\family default
.
 The linker 
\family typewriter
ld
\family default
 uses the default script that it can find in the system to build the executable
 binary.
 In the default script, a segment is assigned a starting address 
\family typewriter
0x8048000
\family default
 and sections belong to it.
 Then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{1^{st}\,section\,address=starting\,segment\,address+section\,offset=0x8048000+0x154=0x08048154}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{2^{nd}\,section\,address=starting\,segment\,address+section\,offset=0x8048000+0x168=0x08048168}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
....
 and so on until the last loadable section...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, the end address of a segment is also the end address of the final
 section.
 We can see this by listing all the segments:

\family default
 understands the following flags:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
ALLOC Section will have space allocated in the process when loaded.
 Set for all sections except those containing debug information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
LOAD Section will be loaded from the file into the child process memory.
 Set for pre-initialized code and data, clear for .bss sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
RELOC Section needs to be relocated before loading.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
READONLY Section cannot be modified by the child process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
CODE Section contains executable code only.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DATA Section contains data only (no executable code).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ROM Section will reside in ROM.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
CONSTRUCTOR Section contains data for constructor/destructor lists.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
HAS_CONTENTS Section is not empty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
NEVER_LOAD An instruction to the linker to not output the section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
COFF_SHARED_LIBRARY A notification to the linker that the section contains
 COFF shared library information.
 COFF is an object file format, similar to ELF.
 While ELF is the file format for an executable binary, COFF is the file
 format for an object file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
IS_COMMON Section contains common symbols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Depends on the circumstance, certain format is advantageous than the others.
 For example, if a memory region contains floating-point numbers, then it
 is better to use the format 
\family typewriter
f
\family default
 than viewing the number as separated 1-byte hex numbers.

Command: 
\family typewriter
print/p
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examining raw memory is useful but usually it is better to have a more human-rea
dable output.
 This command does precisely the task: it pretty-prints an expression.
 An expression can be a global variable, a local variable in current stack
 frame, a function, a register, a number...

Runtime inspection of a program
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main use of a debugger is to examine the state of a program, when it
 is running.

\begin_layout Subsection
Command: 
\family typewriter
break/b
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This command sets a breakpoint at a location in the high-level source code.
 When 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 runs to a specific location marked by a breakpoint, it stops executing
 for a programmer to inspect the current state of a program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
A breakpoint can be set on a line as displayed by an editor.
 Suppose we want to set a breakpoint at line 3 of the program, which is
 the start of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The breakpoint is at line 3, but 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 stopped line 5.
 The reason is that line 3 does not contain code, but a function signature;
 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 only stops where it can execute code.
 The code in the function starts at line 5, the call to 
\family typewriter
printf
\family default
, so 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 stops there.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout --Separator--

\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Line of code is not always the reliable way to specify a breakpoint, as
 the source code can be changed.
 What if 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 should always stop at 
\family typewriter
main
\family default
 function? In this case, a better method is to use the function name directly:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
begin{shellcommand}

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
end{shellcommand}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, regardless of how the source code changes, 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 always stops at the 
\family typewriter
main
\family default
 function.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout --Separator--

\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Sometimes, the debugging program does not contain debug info, or 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 is debugging assembly code.
 In that case, a memory address can be specified as a stop point.
 To get the function address, 
\family typewriter
print
\family default
 command can be used:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
begin{shellcommand}

\backslash
end{shelloutput16.6}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing the address of main, we can easily set a breakpoint with a memory
 address:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
begin{shellcommand}

end{shellcommand}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout --Separator--

\end_layout

\begin_layout Example

\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 can also set breakpoint in any source file.
 Suppose that 
\family typewriter
hello
\family default
 program is composed not just one file but many files e.g.
 
\family typewriter
hello1.c
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
hello2.c
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
hello3.c
\family default
...
 In that case, simply add the filename before either a line number:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Example

\begin_layout Example
Suppose we have a new function

Why should we add a new function and function call instead of using the

 debugging works, the debug info must be installed and loaded.
 It is not worth the trouble for demonstrating this simple command.

Command: 
\family typewriter
ni
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the core, 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 operates on assembly instruction.
 Source line by line debugging is simply an enhancement to make it friendlier
 for programmers.
 Each statement in C translates to one or more assembly instruction, as
 shown with 
\family typewriter
objdump
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
disassemble
\family default
 command.
 With the debug info available, 
\family typewriter
gdb 
\family default
knows how many instructions belong to one line of high-level code; line
 by line debugging is just a execution of assembly instructions of a line
 when moving from the current line to the next.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This command executes the 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 assembly instruction belongs to the current line.
 Until all assembly instructions of the current line are executed, 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 will not move to the next line.
 If the current instruction is a 
\family typewriter
call
\family default
, step over it to the next instruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
When breakpoint is on the 
\family typewriter
printf
\family default
 call and 
\family typewriter
ni
\family default
 is used, it steps through each assembly instruction:

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
int 3
\family default
 only costs a single byte, making it efficient for debugging.
 When 
\family typewriter
int 3
\family default
 instruction is executed, the operating system calls its breakpoint interrupt
 handler.
 The handler then checks what process reaches a breakpoint, pauses it and
 notifies the debugger it has paused a debugged process.
 The debugged process is only paused and that means a debugger is free to
 inspect its internal state, like a surgeon operates on an anesthetic patient.
 Then, the debugger replaces the 
\family typewriter
int 3
\family default
 opcode with the original opcode and executes the original instruction normally.

\begin_layout Example
It is simple to see 
\family typewriter
int 3
\family default
 in action.
 First, we add an 
\family typewriter
int 3
\family default
 instruction where we need 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 to stop:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language=C,showstringspaces=false,tabsize=4,title={\texttt{hello.c}}"

\begin_layout Plain Layout

#include <stdio.h>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    asm("int 3");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    printf("Hello World
\backslash
n");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    return 0;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
int 3
\family default
 precedes 
\family typewriter
printf
\family default
, so 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 is expected to stop at 
\family typewriter
printf
\family default
.
 Next, we compile with debug enable and with Intel syntax:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, start 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 preceded it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Single stepping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When breakpoint is implemented, it is easy to implement single stepping:
 a debugger simply places another 
\family typewriter
int 3
\family default
 opcode in the next instruction.
 So, when a programmer sets a breakpoint at an instruction, the next instruction
 is automatically set by the debugger, thus enable instruction by instruction
 debugging.
 Similarly, source line by line debugging is just the placements of the
 very first opcodes in the two statements with two 
\family typewriter
int 3
\family default
 opcodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How a debugger understands high level source code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DWARF is a debugging file format used by many compilers and debuggers to
 support source level debugging.
 DWARF contains information that maps between entities in the executable
 binary with the source files.
 A program entity can either be data or code.

Debugging Information Entry

, is a description of a program entity.
 A DIE consists of a tag, which specifies the entity that the DIE describes, and
 a list of  attributes that describes the entity.
 Of all the attributes, these two attributes enables source-level debugging:

Where the entity appears in the executable binary
\end_layout

: in which memory address the entity is loaded at runtime.
 With the precise address, 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 can retrieve correct value for a data entity, or place a correct breakpoint
 and stop accordingly for a code entity.
 Without the information of these addresses, 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 would not know where the entities are to inspect them.

In addition to DIEs, another binary-to-source mapping is the 
\emph on
line number table
\emph default
.
 The line number table maps between a line in the source code and at which
 memory address is the start of the line in the executable binary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In sum, to successfully enable source-level debugging, a debugger needs
 to know the precise location of the source files and the load addresses
 at runtime.
 Address matching, between the image layout of the ELF binary and the address
 where it is loaded, is extremely important since debug information relies
 on correct loading address at runtime.
 That is, it assumes the addresses as recorded in the binary image at compile-ti
me the same as at runtime e.g.
 if the load address for 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 section is recorded in the executable binary at 
\family typewriter
0x800000
\family default
, then when the binary actually runs, 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 should really be loaded at 
\family typewriter
0x800000
\family default
 for gdb to be able to correctly match running instructions with high-level
 code statement.
 Address mismatching makes debug information useless, as actual code at
 one address is displayed as code at another address.
 Without this knowledge, we will not be able to build an operating system
 that can be debugged with 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
.

The output is similar to a DIE output, with only attribute names and without
 any value.
 We can also say an abbreviation is a

 of a DIE, as an abbreviation represents the structure of a particular DIE.
 Many DIEs share the same abbreviation, or structure, thus they are of the
 same type.
 An abbreviation number specifies which type a DIE is in the abbreviation
 table above.
 Abbreviations improve encoding efficiency (reduce binary size) because
 each DIE needs not to carry their structure information as pairs of attribute-v

Using BIOS services
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BIOS provides many basic services for controlling the hardware at the boot
 stage.
 A service is a group of routines that controls a particular hardware device,
 or returns information of current system.
 Each service is given an interrupt number.
 To call a BIOS routine, an 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
 instruction must be used with an interrupt number.
 Each BIOS service defines its own numbers for its routines; to call a routine,
 a specific number must be written to a register required by each service.
 The list of all BIOS interrupts is available with Ralf Brown's Interrupt
 List at:

Example Bootloader
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a simple bootloader that does nothing, except not crashing the machine
 but halt it gracefully.
 If the virtual machine does not halt but text repeatedly flashing, it means
 the bootloader does not load properly and the machine crashed.
 The machine crashed because it keeps executing until the near end of physical
 memory (1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

MB in real mode), which is 
\family typewriter
FFFF:0000h
\family default
, which starts the whole BIOS boot process all over again.
 This is effectively a reset, but not fully, since machine environment from
 previous run is still reserved.
 For that reason, it is called a 
\emph on
warm reboot
\emph default
.
 The opposite of warm reboot is 
\emph on
cold reboot
\emph default
, in which the machine environment is reset to initial settings when the
 computer starts from a powerless state.

 Even though x86 was ubiquitous, the minute differences between models made
 some code written for a machine not run on another.
 Further, if you use the same physical computer you write your operating
 system take very long between runs, and also difficult to debug.
 Fortunately, today we can uniformly produce a virtual machine with a particular
 specification and avoid the incompatibility issue altogether, thus making
 an OS easier to write and test since everyone can reproduce the same machine
 environment.

We will be using 
\emph on
QEMU
\emph default
, a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.
 QEMU can emulate various types of machine, not limited to x86_64 only.
 Debug is easy since you can connect GDB to a virtual machine to debug code
 that runs on it, through QEMU's built-in GDB server.
 QEMU can use

Loading a program from bootloader
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we get the feel of how to use the BIOS services, it is time for
 something more complicated.
 We will place our kernel on 2
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
nd
\end_layout

\end_inset

 sector onward, and our bootloader reads 30 sectors starting from 2
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
nd
\end_layout

\end_inset

 sector.
 Why 30 sectors? Our kernel will grow gradually, so we will preserve 30
 sectors and save us time for modifying the bootloader each time the kernel
 size expands another sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary responsibility of a bootloader is to read an operating system
 from some storage device e.g.
 hard disk, then loads it into main memory and transfer the control to the
 loaded operating system, similar to how the BIOS reads and loads a bootloader.
 At the moment, our bootloader does nothing more than just an assembly program
 loaded by the BIOS.
 To make our bootloader a real one, it must perform well the above two tasks:
 
\emph on
read 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
load
\emph default
 an operating system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Floppy Disk Anatomy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To read from a storage device, we must understand how the device works,
 and the provided interface for controlling it.
 First of all, a floppy disk is a storage device, similar to RAM, but can
 store information even when a computer is turned off, thus is called 
\begin_inset Index idx

\end_inset


\emph on
persistent storage device
\emph default
.
 A floppy disk also a persistent storage device, thus it provides a storage
 space up to 1.4 MB, or 1,474,560 bytes.
 When reading from a floppy disk, the smallest unit that can be read is
 a 
\emph on

\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
sector
\end_layout

\end_inset

sector
\emph default

.
 Each side of a floppy disk consists of 80 tracks.
 A floppy drive is required to read a floppy disk.
 Inside a floppy drive contains an arm with 2 
\emph on
heads
\emph default
, each head reads a side of a floppy drive; head 0 writes the upper side
 and head 1 writes the lower side of a floppy disk.

When a floppy drive writes data to a brand new floppy disk, track 0 on the
 upper side is written first, by head 0.
 When the upper track 0 is full, the lower track 0 is used by head 1.
 When both the upper and lower side of a track 0 are full, it goes back
 to head 0 for writing data again, but this time the upper side of track
 1 and so on, until no space left on the device.
 The same procedure is also applied for reading data from floppy disk.

Next, we need to fix the bootloader for reading from the floppy disk and
 load a number of arbitrary sectors.
 Before doing so, a basic understanding of floppy disk is required.
 To read data from disk, interrupt 
\family typewriter

\family typewriter

\family default
 is a routine for reading sectors from disk into memory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
AL = number of sectors to read (1-128 dec.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
CH = track/cylinder number (0-1023 dec., see below)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
DH = head number (0-15 dec.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
DL = drive number (0=A:, 1=2nd floppy, 80h=drive 0, 81h=drive 1)

 (which is

).
 To test the code, load it on a QEMU virtual machine and connect through
 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
, then place a breakpoint at 
\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
.
 If

\family default
 stops at the address, with the assembly listing is the same code as in

 This is an important milestone, as we ensure that our operating system
 are loaded and ran properly.

GNU Make
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is a program that controls and automates the process of building a complex
 software.
 For a small program, like a single C source file, invoking 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
gcc
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is quick and easy.
 However, soon your software will be more complex, with multiples spanning
 multiple directories, it is a chore to manually build and link files.
 To solve such problem, a tool was created to automate away this problem
 and is called a 
\emph on
build system
\emph default
.
 GNU Make is one such of tools.
 There are various build systems out there, but GNU Make is the most popular
 in Linux world, as it is used for building the Linux kernel.

Looking at the Makefile, we can see a few problems: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the name 
\family typewriter
disk.img
\family default
 are all over the place.
 When we want to change the disk image name e.g.
 
\family typewriter
floppy_disk.img
\family default
, all the places with the name 
\family typewriter
disk.img
\family default
 must be changed manually.
 To solve this problem, we use a variable, and every appearance of 
\family typewriter
disk.img
\family default
 is replaced with the reference to the variable.
 This way, only one place that is changed - the variable definition - all
 other places are updated automatically.
 The following variables are added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language={[gnu]make},tabsize=4,commentstyle={\color{mygray}\itshape},frame=shadowbox"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

BOOTLOADER=bootloader.o
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

OS=sample.o
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

DISK_IMG=disk.img.o
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second problem is, the name 
\family typewriter
bootloader
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
sample
\family default
 appears as part of the filenames of the source files e.g.
 
\family typewriter
bootloader.asm 
\family default
and 
\family typewriter
sample.asm
\family default
, as well as the filenames of the binary files e.g.
 
\family typewriter
bootloader
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
sample
\family default
.
 Similar to 
\family typewriter
disk.img
\family default
, when a name changed, every reference of that name must also be changed
 manually for both the names of the source files and the names of the binary
 files e.g.
 if we change 
\family typewriter
bootloader.asm
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
loader.asm
\family default
, then the object file 
\family typewriter
bootloader.o
\family default
 needs changing to 
\family typewriter
loader.o
\family default
.
 To solve this problem, instead of changing filenames manually, we create
 a rule that automatically generate the filenames of one extension to another.
 In this case, we want any source file that starts with 
\family typewriter
.asm 
\family default
to have its equivalent binary files, without any extension e.g.
 
\family typewriter
bootloader.asm
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
bootloader.o
\family default
.
 Such transformation is common, so GNU Make provides built-in functions:
 
\family typewriter
wildcard
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
patsubst
\family default
 for solving such problems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language={[gnu]make},tabsize=4,commentstyle={\color{mygray}\itshape},frame=shadowbox"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

BOOTLOADER_SRCS := $(wildcard *.asm)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

BOOTLOADER_OBJS := $(patsubst %.asm, %.o, $(BOOTLOADER_SRCS))
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
wildcard
\family default
 matches any 
\family typewriter
.asm
\family default
 file in the current directory, then assigned the list of matched files
 into the variable 
\family typewriter
BOOTLOADER_SRCS
\family default
.
 In this case, 
\family typewriter
BOOTLOADER_SRCS 
\family default
is assigned the value: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
bootloader.asm sample.asm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
patsubst
\family default
 substitutes any filename starts with 
\family typewriter
.asm
\family default
 into a filename 
\family typewriter
.o
\family default
 e.g.
 
\family typewriter
bootloader.asm
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
bootloader.o
\family default
.
 After 
\family typewriter
patsubsts
\family default
 runs, we get a list of object files in 
\family typewriter
BOOTLOADER_OBJS
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
bootloader.o sample.o
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, a recipe for building from 
\family typewriter
.asm
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
.o
\family default
 are needed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language={[gnu]make},tabsize=4,commentstyle={\color{mygray}\itshape},frame=shadowbox"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%.o: %.asm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	nasm -f bin $< -o $@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
$<
\family default
 is a special variable that refers to the input of the recipe: 
\family typewriter
%.asm
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
$@
\family default
 is a special variable that refers to the output of the recipe: 
\family typewriter
%.o
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the recipe is executed, the variables are replaced with the actual
 values.
 For example, if a transformation is 
\family typewriter
bootloader.asm 
\family default

\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
bootloader.o
\family default
, then the actual command executed when replace the placeholders in the
 recipe is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o bootloader.o
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the recipe, all the 
\family typewriter
.asm
\family default
 files are built automatically with the 
\family typewriter
nasm
\family default
 command into 
\family typewriter
.o
\family default
 files and we no longer need a separate recipe for each object files.
 Putting it all together with the new variables, we get a better Makefile:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language={[gnu]make},numbers=left,tabsize=4,title={\texttt{Makefile}},commentstyle={\color{mygray}\itshape},frame=shadowbox"

The object files are in the same directory as the source files, making it
 more difficult when working with the source tree.
 Ideally, object files and source files should live in different directories.

Basically everything related to the bootloader in the top-level Makefile
 are extracted into this Makefile.
 When 
\family typewriter
make
\family default
 runs this Makefile,
\family typewriter
 bootloader.o
\family default
 should be built and put into
\color blue
 
\family typewriter
../build
\family default
/
\color inherit
 directory.
 As a good practice, all references to 
\family typewriter
../build/
\family default
 go through 
\family typewriter
BUILD_DIR
\family default
 variable.
 The recipe for transforming from 
\family typewriter
.asm 
\family default

\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
.o
\family default
 is also updated with proper paths, else it will not work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%.asm
\family default
 refers to the assembly source files in the current directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o
\family default
 refers to the output object files in the build directory in the path 
\family typewriter
\color blue
../build/
\family default
\color inherit
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The entire recipe implements the transformation from 
\family typewriter
<source_file.asm>
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
../build/<object_file.o>
\family default
.
 Note that all paths must be correct.
 If we try to build object files in a different directory e.g.
 current directory, it will not work since there is no such recipe exists
 to build objects at such a path.

The build process is now truly modularized:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
bootloader
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
os 
\family default
builds are now delegated to child Makefile of respective components.
 
\family typewriter
-C
\family default
 option tells 
\family typewriter
make
\family default
 to execute with a Makefile in a supplied directory.
 In this case, the directories are
\color blue
 
\family typewriter
bootloader/
\family default
\color inherit
 and 
\family typewriter
\color blue
os/
\family default
\color inherit
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The target 
\family typewriter
all
\family default
 of the top-level Makefile is only responsible for 
\family typewriter
bootdisk
\family default
 target, which is the primary target of this Makefile.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases, a target is not always a filename, but is just a name for
 a recipe to be always executed when requested.
 If a filename is of the same name as a target and the file is up-to-date,
 
\family typewriter
make
\family default
 does not execute the target.
 To solve this problem, 
\family typewriter
.PHONY
\family default
 specifies that some targets are not files.
 All phony targets will then run when requested, regardless of files of
 the same names.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To save time entering the command for starting up a QEMU virtual machine,
 we also add a target to the top-level Makefile:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language={[gnu]make},tabsize=4,commentstyle={\color{mygray}\itshape},frame=shadowbox"

qemu:

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One last problem is project cleaning.
 At the moment, object files need removing manually and this is a repetitive
 process.
 Instead, let the Makefile of each component takes care of cleaning its
 object files, then top-level Makefile performs project cleaning by calling
 the component Makefile to do the jobs.
 Each Makefile is added with a 
\family typewriter
clean
\family default
 target at the end:

GNU Make Syntax summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GNU Make, at its core, is a domain-specific language for build automation.
 As any programming language, it needs a way to define data and code.
 In a Makefile, variables carry data.
 A variable value is either hard coded or evaluated from invoking a shell
 such as Bash.
 All variable values in Make has the same type: a string of text.
 Number 3 is not a number, but textual representation of the symbol 3.
 Here are common ways how to define data in a Makefile:

Code in GNU Make is a collection of recipes that it can run.
 Each recipe is analogous to a function in a programming language, and can
 be called like a regular function.
 Each recipe carries a series of shell commands to be executed by a shell
 e.g.
 Bash.
 A recipe has the following format:
\end_layout

Each

 Each 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
prerequisite
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is a call another target.
 Each command is one of Make's built-in commands or a command that is executable
 by a shell.
 All prerequisites must be satisfied before entering main body of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
target
\end_layout

\end_inset

; that is, each prerequisite must not return any error.
 If any error is returned, Make terminates the whole build process and prints
 an error on the command line.

 in other programming languages.
 However, if 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 This feature is useful to automate multiple aspects in a project.

 Why shouldn't we put commands in

 A symbol reference is the memory address of a symbol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the definition is hard to understand, consider a similar analogy: house
 relocation.
 Suppose that a programmer bought a new house and the new house is empty.
 He must buy furnitures and appliances to fulfill daily needs and thus,
 he made a list of items to buy, and where to place them.
 To visualize the placements of new items, he draws a blueprint of the house
 and the respective places of all items.
 He then travels to the shops to buy goods.
 Whenever he visit a shop and sees matched items, he tells the shop owner
 to note them down.
 After done selecting, he tells the shop owner to pick up a brand new item
 instead of the objects on display, then give the address for delivering
 the goods to his new house.
 Finally, when the goods arrive, he places the items where he planned at
 the beginning.

\begin_layout Itemize
The list of items represents the relocation table, where the memory location
 for each symbol (item) is predetermined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

\emph default
 and its 
\emph on

\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each shop represents a compiled object file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each item on display represents a symbol definition and references in the
 object file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The new address, where all the goods are delivered, represents the final
 executable binary or the final object file.
 Since the items on display are not for sale, the shop owner delivers brand
 new goods instead.
 Similarly, the object files are not merged together, but copied all over
 a new file, the object/executable file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, the goods are placed in the positions according to the shopping
 list made from the beginning.
 Similarly, the symbol definitions are placed appropriately in its respective
 section and the symbol references of the final object/executable file are
 replaced with the actual memory addresses of the symbol definitions.

Now it suffices to understand relocation types.
 Previously, we mentioned the type

 The following formula is applied for relocation (Inteli386 psABI):

\begin_inset Formula $Relocated\,Offset=S+A-P$

 and the actual memory location of a symbol definition, or a memory address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But why do we waste time in calculating a distance instead of replacing
 with a direct memory address? The reason is that x86 architecture does
 not use employ any addressing mode that uses an absolute memory address,
 as listed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "mod-rm-32"

\end_inset

.
 All addressing modes in x86 are relative.
 In some assembly language, an absolute address can be used simply because
 it is a syntactic sugar that is later transformed into one of the relative
 addressing mode provided by the x86 hardware by the assembler.

The distance between the usage of 
\family typewriter
foo
\family default
 in 
\family typewriter

 and its definition, applying the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $S+A-P$
\end_inset

 is: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{2e+0-1c=12}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the place where memory fixing starts is 
\family typewriter
0x12
\family default
 or 18 bytes away from 
\emph on
the definition
\emph default
 of the symbol 
\family typewriter
foo
\family default
.
 However, to make an instruction works properly, we must also subtract 4
 from 
\family typewriter
0x12
\family default
 and results in 
\family typewriter
0xe
\family default
.
 Why the extra 
\family typewriter
-4
\family default
? Because the relative address starts at 
\emph on
the end
\emph default
 of an instruction, 
\emph on
not the address where memory fixing starts
\emph default
.
 For that reason, we must also exclude the 4 bytes of the overwritten address.

\begin_layout Standard
We still get a segmentation fault.
 It is to be expected, as we ran a custom binary without C runtime support
 from the operating system.
 The last statement in the 
\family typewriter
main
\family default
 function: 
\family typewriter
return 0
\family default
, simply returns to a random place
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Return address is above the current 
\family typewriter
ebp
\family default
.
 However, when we enter 
\family typewriter
main
\family default
, no return value is pushed on the stack.
 So, when return is executed, it simply retrieves any value above 
\family typewriter
ebp
\family default
 and use as a return address.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The C runtime ensures that the program exit properly.
 In Linux, the 
\family typewriter
_exit()
\family default
 function is implicitly called when 
\family typewriter
main
\family default
 returns.
 To fix this problem, we simply change the program to exit properly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language=C,numbers=left,showstringspaces=false,tabsize=4,title={\texttt{hello.c}}"
inline false

void test() {}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

        "mov ebx, 0x0

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

        "int 0x80");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inline assembly is required because interrupt 
\family typewriter
0x80
\family default
 is defined for system calls in Linux.
 Since the program uses no library, there is no other way to call system
 functions, aside from using assembly.
 However, when writing our operating system, we will not need such code,
 as there is no environment for exiting properly yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we can precisely control where the program runs initially, it is
 easy to bootstrap the kernel from the bootloader.
 Before we move on to the next section, note how 
\family typewriter
readelf
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
objdump
\family default
 can be applied to debug a program even before it runs.

The structure is incredibly simple.
 Both the segment and section listings can be contained within one screen.
 This is not the case with default ELF executable binary.
 From the output, there are only 11 sections, and only two are loaded at
 runtime: 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
.eh_frame 
\family default
because both section are assigned with an actual memroy addresses, 
\family typewriter
\color blue
0x10000
\family default
 
\color inherit
and 
\family typewriter
\color blue
0x10010
\family default

respectively.
 The remaining sections are assigned with

0

The program segment header table is even simpler.
 It only contains 2 segments: 
\family typewriter
LOAD
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
GNU_STACK
\family default
.
 By default, if the linker script does not supply the instructions for building
 program segments, 
\family typewriter
ld
\family default
 provides reasonable default segments.
 As in this case, 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 should be in the 
\family typewriter
LOAD
\family default
 segment.
 
\family typewriter
GNU_STACK
\family default
 segment is a GNU extension used by the Linux kernel to control the state
 of the program stack.
 We will not need this segment, along with 
\family typewriter
.eh_frame
\family default
, which is for exception handling, as we write our own operating system
 from scratch.
 To achieve these goals, we will need to create our own program headers
 instead of letting 
\family typewriter
ld
\family default
 handles the task, and instruct ld to remove 
\family typewriter
.eh_frame
\family default
.

The content of

PHDRS
\family default
 command tells that the final executable binary contains 2 program segments:
 
\family typewriter
NULL
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
LOAD
\family default
.
 The 
\family typewriter
NULL
\family default
 segment is given the name 
\family typewriter
null 
\family default
and 
\family typewriter
LOAD
\family default
 segment given the name code to signify this 
\family typewriter
LOAD
\family default
 segment contains program code.
 Then, to put a section into a segment, we use the syntax 
\family typewriter
:<phdr>
\family default
, where 
\family typewriter
phdr
\family default
 is the name given to a segment earlier.
 In this example,

\family default
 section is put into 
\family typewriter

\family default

 However, this attribute should only added for the first program segment,
 as it drastically alters the size and starting address of a segment because
 the ELF header is always at the beginning of a binary file, recall that
 a segment starts at the address of its first content, which is in most
 of the cases (except for this case, which is the file header), the first
 section.

The size of the 
\family typewriter
LOAD
\family default
 segment in the previous example is only 
\family typewriter
0x68
\family default
, the same size as the total sizes of 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
.eh_frame
\family default
 sections in it.
 But now, it is 
\family typewriter
\color blue
0x01068
\family default
\color inherit
, got 
\family typewriter
0x1000
\family default
 bytes larger.
 What is the reason for these extra bytes? A simple answer: segment alignment.
 From the output, the alignment of this segment is 
\family typewriter
0x1000
\family default
; it means that regardless of which address is the start of this segment,
 it must be divisible by 
\family typewriter
0x1000
\family default
.
 For that reason, the starting address of 
\family typewriter
LOAD
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
\color red
0xf000
\family default
\color inherit
 because it is divisible by 
\family typewriter
0x1000
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another question arises: why is the starting address 
\family typewriter
\color red
0xf000
\family default
\color inherit
 instead of 
\family typewriter
0x10000
\family default
? 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 is the first section, which starts at 
\family typewriter
0x10000
\family default
, so the segment should start at 
\family typewriter
0x10000
\family default
.
 The reason is that we include 
\family typewriter
FILEHDR
\family default
 as part of the segment, it must expand to include the ELF file header,
 which is at the very start of an ELF executable binary.
 To satisfy this constraint and the alignment constraint, 
\family typewriter
\color red
0xf000
\family default
\color inherit
 is the closest address.
 Note that the virtual and physical memory addresses are the addresses at
 runtime, not the locations of the segment in the file on disk.
 As the 
\family typewriter
FileSiz
\family default
 field shows, the segment only consumes 
\family typewriter
\color blue
0x1068
\family default
\color inherit
 bytes on disk.

\family default
 since the program segment header table appears right after the ELF header.

\emph default
 is a starting address of a segment or a section when a program is in memory
 and running.
 The memory address is called virtual because it does not map to the actual
 memory cell that corresponds to the address number, but any random memory
 cell, which depends on how the underlying operating system translates the
 address.
 For example, the virtual memory address 
\family typewriter
0x1
\family default
 might map to the memory cell with the physical address 
\family typewriter
0x1000
\family default
.

load memory address

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The load memory address is specified by 
\family typewriter
AT
\family default
 syntax.
 Normally both types of addresses are the same, and the physical address
 can be ignored.
 They differ when loading and running are purposely divided into two distinct
 phases that require different address regions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a program can be designed to load into a ROM
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Read-Only Memory
\end_layout

\end_inset

 at a fixed address.
 But when loading into RAM for a bare-metal application or an operating
 system to use, the program needs a load address that accommodates the addressin
g scheme of the target application or operating system.

\family default
 section is to initialize a C Runtime environment that supports the C standard
 libraries.
 Why does C need a runtime environment, when it is supposed to be a compiled
 language? The reason is that many of the standard functions depend on the
 underlying operating system, which is of itself a big runtime environment.
 For example, I/O related functions such as reading from keyboard with 
\family typewriter
gets()
\family default
, reading from file with 
\family typewriter
open()
\family default
, printing on screen with 
\family typewriter
printf()
\family default
, managing system memory with 
\family typewriter
malloc()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
free()
\family default
, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A C implementation cannot provide such routines without a running operating
 system, which is a
\emph on
 hosted environment
\emph default
.
 A 
\emph on

\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
hosted environment
\end_layout

\end_inset

hosted environment
\emph default
 is a runtime environment that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
provides a default implementation of C libraries that includes system-dependent
 data and routines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
perform resource allocations to prepare an environment for a program to
 run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This process is similar to the hardware initialization process:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When first powered up, a desktop computer loads its basic system routines
 from a read-only memory stored on the motherboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then, it starts initializing an environment, such as setting default values
 for various registers in CPU and devices, before executing the any code.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, a 
\emph on

\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
freestanding environment
\end_layout

\end_inset

freestanding environment
\emph default
 is an environment that does not provide system-dependent data and routines.
 As a consequence, almost no C library exists and the environment can run
 code compiled written from pure C syntax.
 For a free standing environment to become a host environment, it must implement
 standard C system routines.
 But for a 
\emph on
conforming
\emph default
 freestanding environment, it only needs these header files available: 
\family typewriter
<float.h>
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
<limits.h>
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
<stadarg.h>
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
<stddef.h>
\family default
 (according to GCC manual).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a typical desktop x86 program, C runtime environment is initialized
 by a compiler so a program runs normal.
 However, for an embedded platform where a program runs directly on it,
 this is not the case.
 The typical C runtime environment used in desktop operating systems cannot
 be used on the embedded platforms, because architectural differences and
 resource constraints.
 As such, the software writer must implement a custom C runtime environment
 suitable for the targeted platform.
 For the embedded platform, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In writing our operating system, the first step is to create a freestanding
 environment before creating a hosted one.

\begin_layout Section
Debuggable bootloader on bare metal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, the bootloader is compiled as a flat binary file.
 Although 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 can display the assembly code, it is not always the same as the source
 code.
 In the assembly source code, there exists variable names and labels.
 These symbols are lost when compiled as a flat binary file, making debugging
 more difficult.
 Another issue is the mismatch between the written assembly source code
 and the displayed assembly source code.
 The written code might contain higher level syntax that is assembler-specific
 and is generated into lower-level assembly code as displayed by 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
.
 Finally, with debug information available, the command 
\family typewriter
next/n
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
prev/p
\family default
 can be used instead of 
\family typewriter
ni
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
si
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To enable debug information, we modify the bootloader Makefile:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The bootloader must be compiled as a ELF binary.
 Open the Makefile in bootloader/ directory and change this line under 
\family typewriter
$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: %.asm
\family default
 recipe:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language={[gnu]make},tabsize=4"
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

nasm -f bin $< -o $@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

to this line:

\begin_layout Plain Layout

nasm -f elf $< -F dwarf -g -o $@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the updated recipe, 
\family typewriter
bin
\family default
 format is replaced with 
\family typewriter
elf
\family default
 format to enable debugging information to be properly produced.
\family typewriter
-F
\family default
 option specifies the debug information format, which is 
\family typewriter
dwarf
\family default
 in this case.
 Finally, 
\family typewriter
-g
\family default
 option causes 
\family typewriter
nasm
\family default
 to actually generate debug information in selected format.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Then, 
\family typewriter
ld
\family default
 consumes the ELF bootloader binary and produces another ELF bootloader
 binary, with proper
\family typewriter
 
\family default
starting memory address of 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 section that match the actual address of the bootloader at runtime, when
 QEMU virtual machine loads it at 
\family typewriter
0x7c00
\family default
.
 We need 
\family typewriter
ld
\family default
 because when compiled by 
\family typewriter
nasm
\family default
, the starting address is assumed to be 
\family typewriter
0
\family default
, not 
\family typewriter
0x7c00
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, we use 
\family typewriter
objcopy
\family default
 to separate extract only the flat binary content as the original bootloader
 by adding this line to 
\family typewriter
$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: %.asm
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
objcopy
\family default
, as its name implies, is a program that copies and translates object files.
 Here, we copy the original ELF bootloader and translate it into a flat
 binary file.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The updated recipe should look like:

\begin_layout Section
Debuggable program on bare metal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of building a debug-ready executable binary is similar to that
 of a bootloader, except more involved.
 Recall that for a debugger to work properly, its debugging information
 must contain correct address mappings between memory addresses and the
 source code.
 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 stores such mapping information in DIE entries, in which it tells 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 at which code address corresponds to a line in a source file, so that breakpoin
ts work properly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But first, we need a sample C source file, a very simple one:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "title={\texttt{os.c}}"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

void main() {}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because this is a free standing environment, standard libraries that involve
 system functions such as 
\family typewriter
printf()
\family default
 would not work, because a C runtime does not exist.
 At this stage, the goal is to correctly jump to main with source code displayed
 properly in 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
, so no fancy C code is needed yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is updating 
\family typewriter
os/Makefile

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We updated the Makefile with the following changes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Add a 
\family typewriter
CFLAGS
\family default
 variable for passing options to 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Instead of the rule to build assembly source code earlier, it is replaced
 with a C version with a recipe to build C source files.
 The 
\family typewriter
CFLAGS
\family default
 variable makes the 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 command in the recipe looks cleaner regardless how many options are added.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Add a linking command for building the final executable binary of the operating
 system with a custom linker script 
\family typewriter
\color blue
os.lds
\family default
\color inherit
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everything looks good, except for the linker script part.
 Why is it needed? The linker script is required for controlling at which
 physical memory address the operating system binary appears in the memory,
 so the linker can jump to the operating system code and execute it.
 To complete this requirement, the default linker script used by 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 would not work as it assumes the compiled executable runs inside an existing
 operating system, while we are writing an operating system itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next question is, what will be the content in the linker script? To
 answer this question, we must understand what goals to achieve with the
 linker script:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the bootloader to correctly jump to and execute the operating system
 code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 to debug correctly with the operating system source code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve the goals, we must devise a design of a suitable memory layout
 for the operating system.
 Recall that the bootloader developed in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Bootloader"

\end_inset

 can already load a simple binary compiled from the sample Assembly program
 
\family typewriter
sample.asm
\family default
.
 To load the operating system, we can simply throw binary compiled from
 
\family typewriter
sample.asm
\family default
 with the binary compiled from 
\family typewriter
os.c
\family default
 above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If only it is that simple.
 The idea is correctly, but not enough.
 The goals implies the following constraints:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The operating system code is written in C and compiled as an ELF executable
 binary.
 It means, the bootloader needs to retrieve correct entry address from the
 ELF header.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To debug properly with 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
, the debug info must contain correct mappings between instruction addresses
 and source code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thanks to the understanding of ELF and DWARF acquire in the earlier chapters,
 we can certainly modify the bootloader and create an executable binary
 that satisfy the above constraint.
 We will solve these problems one by one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Loading an ELF binary from a bootloader
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earlier we examined that an ELF header contains a entry address of a program.
 That information is 0x18 bytes away from the beginning of an ELF header,
 according to 
\family typewriter

It is as simple as that! First, we load the operating system binary at 
\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
, then we retrieve the entry address at the offset 
\family typewriter
0x18
\family default
 from 
\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
, by first calculating the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $500h+18h=518h$
\end_inset

 to get the actual in-memory address, then retrieve the content by dereference
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part is done.
 For the next part, we need to build an ELF operating system image for the
 bootloader to load.
 The first step is to create a linker script:

The script is straight-forward and remains almost the same as before.
 The only differences are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

ENTRY(main)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
text
\family default
 is explicitly specified with 
\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
 as its 
\emph on

The assembly code of

main
\family default
 is completely different.
 This is why understanding assembly code and its relation to high-level
 languages are important.
 Without the knowledge, we would have used 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 as a simple source-level debugger without bother looking at the assembly
 code from the split layout.
 As a consequence, the true cause of the non-working code could never been
 discovered.

 But why was the address wrong? We made the

\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
, in which 
\family typewriter

 to retrieve the address at the offset

Then, it might be possible for the bootloader to load the operating system

Here is the problem: 
\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
 is the start of the ELF header.
 The bootloader actually loads the 2
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
nd
\end_layout

\end_inset

 sector, which stores the executable as a whole, to 
\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
.
 Clearly, .
\family typewriter
text
\family default
 section, where 
\family typewriter
main
\family default
 resides, is far from 
\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
.
 Since the in-memory entry address of the executable binary is 
\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 should be at 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{0x500+0x500=0xa00}$
\end_inset


\family default
.
 However, the entry address recorded in the ELF header remains 
\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
 and as a result, the bootloader jumped there instead of 
\family typewriter
0xa00
\family default
.
 This is one of the issues that must be fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other issue is the mapping between debug info and the memory address.
 Because the debug info is compiled with the assumed offset 
\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
 that is the start of 
\family typewriter
.text
\family default
 section, but due to actual loading, the offset is pushed another 
\family typewriter
0x500
\family default
 bytes, making the address actually is at 
\family typewriter
0xa00
\family default
.
 This memory mismatch renders the debug info useless.

Notice the

 field, but the

The key to answer such phenonemon is in the 
\family typewriter
Align
\family default
 field.
 The value 
\family typewriter
0x1000
\family default
 indicates that the offset address of the segment should be divisible by
 
\family typewriter
0x1000
\family default
, or if the distance between segment is divisible by 
\family typewriter
0x1000
\family default
, the linker removes such distance to save the binary size.
 We can do some experiments to verify this claim

Both raw opcode displayed by the two programs are the same.
 In this case, it proved that 
\family typewriter
gdb
\family default
 correctly jumped to the address of 
\family typewriter
main
\family default
 for a proper debugging.
 This is an extremely important milestone.
 Being able to debug in bare metal will help tremendously in writing an
 operating system, as a debugger allows a programmer to inspect the internal
 state of a running machine at each step to verify his code, step by step,
 to gradually build up a solid understanding.
 Some professional programmers do not like debuggers, but it is because
 they understand their domain deep enough to not need to rely on a debugger
 to verify their code.
 When encountering new domains, a debugger is indispensable learning tool
 because of its verifiability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, even with the aid of debugger, writing an operating system is still
 not a walk in the park.
 The debugger may give the access to the machine at one point in time, but
 it does not give the cause.
 To find out the root cause, is up to the ability of a programmer.
 Later in the book, we will learn how to use other debugging techniques,
 such as using QEMU logging facility to debug CPU exceptions.

Basic operating system concepts

\begin_layout Standard
The first and foremost, OS manages hardware resources.
 It's easy to see the core features of an OS based on Von Neumann diagram:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
CPU
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

management: allows programs to share CPU for multitasking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Memory
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

management: allocates enough storage for programs to run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Devices
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

management: detects and communicates with different devices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any OS should be good at the above fundamentals tasks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important feature of an OS is to provide an software interface layer,
 that hides away hardware interfaces, to interface with applications that
 run on top of that OS.
 The benefits of such a layer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
reusability: that is, the same software API can be reused across programs,
 thus simplifying software development process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
separation of concerns: bugs appear either in application programs, or in
 the OS; a programmer needs to isolate where the bugs are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
simplify software development process: provides an easier to use software
 interface layer with a uniform access to hardware resources across devices,
 instead of directly using the hardware interface of a particular device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hardware Abstraction Layer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are so many hardware devices out there, so it's best to leave the
 hardware engineers how the devices talk to an OS.
 To achieve this goal, the OS only provides a set of agreed software interfaces
 between itself and the device driver writers and is called 
\emph on
Hardware Abstraction
\emph default
 
\emph on
Layer
\emph default
.
\end_layout

In C, this software interface is implemented through a structure function
 pointers.

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
System programming interfaces
\emph default
 are standard interfaces that an OS provides application programs to use
 its services.
 For example, if a program wishes to read a file on disk, then it must call
 a function like 
\emph on
open()
\emph default
 and let the OS handle the details of talking to the hard disk for retrieving
 the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The need for an Operating System 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a way, OS is an overhead, but a necessary one, for a user to tell a computer
 what to do.
 When resources in a computer system (CPU, GPU, memory, hard drive...) became
 big and more complicated, it's tedious to manually manage all the resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Imagine we have to manually load programs on a computer with 3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

GB of RAM.
 We would have to load programs at various fix addresses, and for each program
 a size must be manually calculated to avoid wasting memory resource, and
 enough for programs to not overriding each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or, when we want to give computer input through the keyboard, without an
 OS, an application also has to carry code to facilitate the communication
 with keyboard hardware; each application then handles such keyboard communicati
on on its own.
 Why should there be such duplications across applications for such standard
 feature? If you write an accounting software, why should a programmer concern
 writing a keyboard driver, totally irrelevant to the problem domain?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's why a crucial job of an OS is to hide the complexity of hardware
 devices, so a program is freed from the burden of maintaining its own code
 for hardware communication by having a standardized set of interfaces and
 thus, reduce potential bugs along with faster development time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To write an OS effectively, a programmer need to understand well the underlying
 computer architecture that programmer are writing an OS for.
 The first reason is, many OS concepts are supported by the architecture
 e.g.
 the concepts of virtual memory are well supported by x86 architecture.
 If the underlying computer architecture is not well-understood, OS developers
 are doomed to reinvent it in your OS, and such software-implemented solutions
 run slower than the hardware version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Drivers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drivers are programs that enable an OS to communicate and use features of
 hardware devices.
 For example, a keyboard driver enables an OS to get input from keyboard;
 or a network driver allows a network card to send and receive data packets
 to and from the Internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you only write application programs, you may wonder how can software
 control hardware devices? As mentioned in Chapter 2, through the hardware-softw
are interface: by writing to a device's registers or to write to ports of
 a device, through the use of CPU's instructions.

Userspace and kernel space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Kernel space
\emph default
 refers to the working environment of an OS that only the kernel can access.
 Kernel space includes the direct communication with hardware, or manipulate
 privileged memory regions (such as kernel code and data).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, 
\emph on
userspace
\emph default
 refers to less privileged processes that run above the OS, and is supervised
 by the OS.
 To access the kernel facility, user program must go through the standardized
 system programming interfaces provided by the OS.

Task
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\emph on
task
\emph default
 is a unit of work that an OS needs to do, similar to how human have tasks
 to do daily.
 From a user point of view, a task for a computer to do can be web browsing,
 document editing, gaming, sending and receiving emails...
 Since a CPU can only execute sequentially, one instruction after another
 (fetching from main memory), there must be some way to do many meaningful
 tasks at once.
 For that reason, the computer must share the resources e.g.
 registers, stack, memory...
 between tasks, since we have many tasks but single and limited resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Process
\emph default
 is a data structure that keeps track of the execution state of a task.
 Task is a general concept, and process is the implementation of a task.
 In a general-purpose OS, a task is usually a program.
 For example, when you run Firefox, a process structure is created to keep
 track of where the stack and the heap allocated for firefox are, where
 Firefox's code area is and which instruction EIP is holding to execute
 next...
 The typical process structure looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[insert process image]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Process is a virtual computer, but much more primitive than the virtual
 machine in virtualization software like Virtual Box, and that's a good
 thing.
 Imagine having to run a full-fledged virtual machine for every task; how
 wasteful of machine resources that would be..
 In the view of a running process, its code executes as if it runs directly
 on hardware.
 Each process has its own set of register values, which are kept tracked
 by the OS, and its own contiguous virtual memory space (which is discontiguous
 in actual physical memory).
 The code in a process is given virtual memory addresses to read and write
 from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[ illustrate: - a process looks like a mini Von Neumann - with contiguous
 memory, each with a color; each cell of a process mapped to distant memory
 cell in physical memory ]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A process can run so much until the OS tells it to temporary stop for other
 tasks to use the hardware resources.
 The suspended process can then wait until further notice from the OS.
 This whole switching process is so fast that a computer user think his
 computer actually runs tasks in parallel.
 The program that does the switching between tasks is called a *scheduler*.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scheduler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An OS needs to perform a wide range of different functionalities, e.g.
 web browsing, document editing, gaming...
 A 
\emph on
scheduler
\emph default
 decides which tasks got to run before the others and, for how long, in
 an efficient manner.
 Scheduler enables your computer to become a 
\emph on
time sharing system
\emph default
, because tasks share CPU execution time and no one process can monopolize
 the CPU (in practice, it still happens regularly).
 Without a scheduler, only a single task can be performed at a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Context switch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a process is prepared to be switched out for another process to take
 its place, certain hardware resources i.e.
 current open files, current register values...
 must be backed up to later resume that process's execution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Priority
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Priority
\emph default
 is an important metric for OS to decide which task is scheduled to run
 before the others to allocate appropriate CPU execution time for each task.

Process states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
State
\emph default
 is a particular condition of a process, triggered by an action from the
 scheduler.
 A process goes through various states during its life cycle.
 A process typically has these states:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Run indicating CPU is executing code in this process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Sleep (or Suspended): indicating CPU is executing some process else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Destroyed: process is done and waiting to be destroyed completely.

Threads
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Threads
\emph default
 are units of work inside a process that shares the execution environment.
 A process creates a whole new execution environment with code of its own:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[illustration between process and thread, with each process is a big rectangle
 box and threads nested boxes point to different code region]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of creating a completely new process structure in memory, OS simply
 let the thread uses some of the resources of the parent process that created
 it.
 A thread has its own registers, program counter, stack pointer, and its
 own call stack.
 Everything else is shared between the threads, such as an address space,
 heap, static data, and code segments, and file descriptors.
 Because thread simply reuses existing resources and involve no context
 switching, it is much faster to create and switch between processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, note that the above scheme is just an implementation of thread
 concept.
 You can completely treat thread the same as process (hence you can call
 all processes threads and vice versa).
 Or you can just back up some resources, whlie leaving some resources shared.
 It's up to the OS designer to distinguish between threads and processes.
 Threads are usually implemented as a component of a process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Linux, a thread is simply a process that shares resources with its parent
 process; for that reason, a Linux thread is also called *light-weight process*.
 Or put it another way, a thread in Linux is merely an implementation of
 a single-threaded process that execute its main program code.
 A multi-threaded program in Linux is just a process with shared with its
 single-threaded children processes, each points to different code region
 of its parent process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[TODO: turn the above table into a diagram]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Windows, threads and processes are two separated entities, so the above
 description for Linux does not apply.
 However, the general idea: a thread shares the execution environment, holds.

Address Space

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Address space
\emph default
 is the set of all addressable memory locations.
 There are 2 types of address spaces in physical memory address:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One for memory: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One for I/O:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each process has its own address space to do whatever it wants, as long
 as the physical memory is not exhausted.
 This address space is called 
\emph on
virtual memory
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Virtual Memory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Physical memory is a contagious memory locations that has a simple mapping
 between a physical memory address and its corresponding location in memory,
 decoded by memory controller.
 On the other hand, *virtual memory* does not have direct mapping between
 a memory address and the corresponding physical memory location, even though
 it appears contagious from the view of an userspace program.
 Instead, virtual memory address is translated by OS into an actual physical
 memory address.
 For that reason, even addresses appear next to each other in virtual memory
 space, they are scattered through out the physical memory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why virtual memory is needed? Because virtual memory reduces the complexity
 of programming, by giving each program an illusion that it has its own
 separate "physical" memory to work with.
 Without virtual memory, programs must know and agree with each other their
 own memory regions to not accidentally destroy each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[illustration a world without virtual memory]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtual memory also enables a more secured OS, as application programs cannot
 manipulate main memory directly, so malicious programs won't cause havocs
 by destroying main memory and possibly hardware devices, by gaining access
 to hardware I/O ports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another benefit is that virtual memory can extend beyond physical memory,
 by storing its data to hard disk.
 By swapping some of unused memory (i.e.
 inactive memory of a sleeping process), the system gains some free memory
 to continue running, so no data is destroyed.
 Otherwise, the OS is forced to kill a random user process to free up some
 memory, and you may lose unsaved work that belongs to the killed process.
 However, this process can significantly slow down the whole system because
 of Von Neumann bottleneck.
 In the old days, when memory was scarce, it was useful.

File System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
File system
\emph default
 is a mechanism on how raw bytes in a storage device can be meaningfully
 managed.
 That is, a group of bytes at specific locations in a storage device can
 be allocated for a purpose e.g.
 storing raw ASCII document, and later the exact chunks of bytes can be
 retrieved correctly.
 File system manages many such groups of bytes.
 It's helpful to think a file system as a database that maps between high
 level information and specific locations in a hard disk, similar to how
 business information is mapped to a specific row in a table.
 The high level information that is relevant to a file system is organized
 as *files* and *directories*.

File
\emph default
 is an entity that includes two components: metadata and the actual raw
 data.
 
\emph on
Metadata
\emph default
 is the information describes the properties of the raw data associated
 with the file; raw data are real content of a file.
 
\emph on
Directory
\emph default
 is a file that holds a group of files and also child directories.
 Together, they create a file hierarchy system as commonly seen in Windows
 or Linux.
