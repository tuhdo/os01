The Anatomy of a Program<chap:The-Anatomy-of-a-program>

Every program consists of code and data, and only those two
components made up a program. However, if a program consists
purely code and data of its own, from the perspective of an
operating system (as well as human), it does not know in a
program, which block of binary is a program and which is just raw
data, where in the program to start execution, which region of
memory should be protected and which is free to modify. For that
reason, each program carries extra metadata to communicate with
the operating system how to handle the program.

When a source file is compiled, the generated machine code is
stored into an object file[margin:
object file
]object file, which is just a block of binary. One or more object
files can be combined to produce an executable binary[margin:
executable binary
]executable binary, which is a complete program runnable in an
operating system.

readelf is a program that recognizes and displays the ELF
metadata of a binary file, be it an object file or an executable
binary. ELF, or Executable and Linkable Format, is the content at
the very beginning of an executable to provide an operating
system necessary information to load into main memory and run the
executable. ELF can be thought of similar to the table of
contents of a book. In a book, a table of contents list the page
numbers of the main sections, subsections, sometimes even figures
and tables for easy lookup. Similarly, ELF lists various sections
used for code and data, and the memory addresses of each symbol
along with other information.

An ELF binary is composed of:

• An ELF header[margin:
ELF header
]ELF header: the very first section of an executable that
  describes the file's organization.

• A Program header table[margin:
program header table
]program header table: is an array of fixed-size structures that
  describes segments of an executable.

• A Section header table[margin:
section header table
]section header table: is an array of fixed-size structures that
  describes sections of an executable.

• Segments and section[margin:
Segments and sections
]Segments and sections are the main content of an ELF binary,
  which are the code and data, divided into chunks of different
  purposes.

  A segmentsegment is a composition of zero or more sections and
  is directly loaded by an operating system at runtime.

  A sectionsection is a block of binary that is either:

  – actual program code and data that is available in memory when
    a program runs.

  – metadata about other sections used only in the linking
    process, and disappear from the final executable.

  Linker uses sections to build segments.

]

Later we will compile our kernel as an ELF executable with GCC,
and explicitly specify how segments are created and where they
are loaded in memory through the use a linker script, a text file
to instruct how a linker should generate a binary. For now, we
will examine the anatomy of an ELF executable in detail.

The [margin:
ELF specification
]ELF specification is bundled as a man page in Linux:



$ man elf



It is a useful resource to understand and implement ELF. However,
it will be much easier to use after you finish this chapter, as
the specification mixes implementation details in it.

The default specification is a generic one, in which every ELF
implementation follows. However, each platform provides extra
features unique to it. The ELF specification for x86 is currently
maintained on Github by H.J. Lu: https://github.com/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/wiki/X86-psABI
.

Platform-dependent details are referred to as “processor specific”
 in the generic ELF specification. We will not explore these
details, but study the generic details, which are enough for
crafting an ELF binary image for our operating system.

  ELF header

To see the information of an ELF header:



$ readelf -h hello



The output:

Let's go through each field:

  Magic

  Displays the raw bytes that uniquely addresses a file is an ELF
  executable binary. Each byte gives a brief information.

  In the example, we have the following magic bytes:



  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00



  Examine byte by byte:

   
  Byte                       Description
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    7f 45 4c 46                Predefined values. The first byte is always 7F, the remaining 3
bytes represent the string “ELF”.

    02                         See Class field below.

    01                         See Data field below.

    01                         See Version field below.

    00                         See OS/ABI field below.

    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00    Padding bytes. These bytes are unused and are always set to 0.
Padding bytes are added for proper alignment, and is reserved for
future use when more information is needed.


  Class

  A byte in Magic field. It specifies the class or capacity of a
  file.

  Possible values:

   
  Value     Description
  ---------------------------
      0      Invalid class
      1      32-bit objects
      2      64-bit objects


  Data

  A byte in Magic field. It specifies the data encoding of the
  processor-specific data in the object file.

  Possible values:

   
  Value    Description
  ------------------------------------------
      0      Invalid data encoding
      1      Little endian, 2's complement
      2      Big endian, 2's complement


  Version

  A byte in Magic. It specifies the ELF header version number.

  Possible values:

   
  Value    Description
  ----------------------------
      0      Invalid version
      1      Current version


  OS/ABI

  A byte in Magic field. It specifies the target operating system
  ABI. Originally, it was a padding byte.

  Possible values: Refer to the latest ABI document, as it is a
  long list of different operating systems.

  Type

  Identifies the object file type.

   
  Value     Description
            -----------------------------------
  ---------------------------------------------
      0       No file type
      1       Relocatable file
      2       Executable file
      3       Shared object file
      4       Core file
    0xff00    Processor specific, lower bound
    0xffff    Processor specific, upper bound


  The values from 0xff00 to 0xffff are reserved for a processor
  to define additional file types meaningful to it.

  Machine

  Specifies the required architecture value for an ELF file e.g.
  x86_64, MIPS, SPARC, etc. In the example, the machine is of x86_64
   architecture.

  Possible values: Please refer to the latest ABI document, as it
  is a long list of different architectures.

  Version

  Specifies the version number of the current object file (not
  the version of the ELF header, as the above Version field
  specified).

  Entry point address

  Specifies the memory address where the very first code to be
  executed. The address of main function is the default in a
  normal application program, but it can be any function by
  explicitly specifying the function name to gcc. For the
  operating system we are going to write, this is the single most
  important field that we need to retrieve to bootstrap our
  kernel, and everything else can be ignored.

  Start of program headers

  The offset of the program header table, in bytes. In the
  example, this number is 64 bytes, which means the 65th byte, or
  <start address> + 64, is the start address of the program
  header table. That is, if a program is loaded at address 0x10000
   in memory, then the start address is 0x10000 (the very first
  byte of Magic field, where the value 0x7f resides) and the
  start address of program header table is 0x10000 + 0x40 = 0x10040
  .

  Start of section headers

  The offset of the section header table in bytes, similar to the
  start of program headers. In the example, it is 6648 bytes into
  file.

  Flags

  Hold processor-specific flags associated with the file. When
  the program is loaded, in a x86 machine, EFLAGS register is set
  according to this value. In the example, the value is 0x0,
  which means EFLAGS register is in a clear state.

  Size of this header

  Specifies the total size of ELF header's size in bytes. In the
  example, it is 64 bytes, which is equivalent to Start of
  program headers. Note that these two numbers are not necessary
  equivalent, as program header table might be placed far away
  from the ELF header. The only fixed component in the ELF
  executable binary is the ELF header, which appears at the very
  beginning of the file.

  Size of program headers

  Specifies the size of each program header in bytes. In the
  example, it is 64 bytes.

  Number of program headers

  Specifies the total number of program headers. In the example,
  the file has a total of 9 program headers.

  Size of section headers

  Specifies the size of each section header in bytes. In the
  example, it is 64 bytes.

  Number of section headers

  Specifies the total number of section headers. In the example,
  the file has a total of 31 section headers. In a section header
  table, the first entry in the table is always an empty section.

  Section header string table index

  Specifies the index of the header in the section header table
  that points to the section that holds all null-terminated
  strings. In the example, the index is 28, which means it's the
  28[superscript:th] entry of the table.

  Section header table

As we know already, code and data compose a program. However, not
all types of code and data have the same purpose. For that
reason, instead of a big chunk of code and data, they are divided
into smaller chunks, and each chunk must satisfy these conditions
(according to gABI):

• Every section in an object file has exactly one section header
  describing it. But, section headers may exist that do not have
  a section.

• Each section occupies one contiguous (possibly empty) sequence
  of bytes within a file. That means, there's no two regions of
  bytes that are the same section.

• Sections in a file may not overlap. No byte in a file resides
  in more than one section.

• An object file may have inactive space. The various headers and
  the sections might not “cover” every byte in an object file.
  The contents of the inactive data are unspecified.

To get all the headers from an executable binary e.g. hello, use
the following command:



$ readelf -S hello



Here is a sample output (do not worry if you don't understand the
output. Just skim to get your eyes familiar with it. We will
dissect it soon enough):



There are 31 section headers, starting at offset 0x19c8:

The first line:



There are 31 section headers, starting at offset 0x19c8



summarizes the total number of sections in the file, and where
the address where it starts. Then, comes the listing section by
section with the following header, is also the format of each
section output:



[Nr] Name              Type             Address           Offset

     Size              EntSize          Flags  Link  Info  Align



Each section has two lines with different fields:

  Nr The index of each section.

  Name The name of each section.

  Type This field (in a section header) identifies the type of
  each section. Types classify sections (similar to types in
  programming languages are used by a compiler).

  Address The starting virtual address of each section. Note that
  the addresses are virtual only when a program runs in an OS
  with support for virtual memory enabled. In our OS, since we
  run on bare metal, the addresses will all be physical.

  Offset The offset of each section into a file. An [margin:
offset
]offsetoffset is a distance in bytes, from the first byte of a
  file to the start of an object, such as a section or a segment
  in the context of an ELF binary file.

  Size The size in bytes of each section.

  EntSize Some sections hold a table of fixed-size entries, such
  as a symbol table. For such a section, this member gives the
  size in bytes of each entry. The member contains 0 if the
  section does not hold a table of fixed-size entries.

  Flags describes attributes of a section. Flags together with a
  type defines the purpose of a section. Two sections can be of
  the same type, but serve different purposes. For example, even
  though .data and .text share the same type, .data holds the
  initialized data of a program while .text holds executable
  instructions of a program. For that reason, .data is given read
  and write permission, but not executable. Any attempt to
  execute code in .data is denied by the running OS: in Linux,
  such invalid section usage gives a segmentation fault.

  ELF gives information to enable an OS with such protection
  mechanism. However, running on bare metal, nothing can prevent
  from doing anything. Our OS can execute code in data section,
  and vice versa, writing to code section.

  Link and Info are numbers that references the indexes of
  sections, symbol table entries, hash table entries. Link field
  holds the index of a section, while Info field holds an index
  of a section, a symbol table entry or a hash table entry,
  depends on the type of a section.

  Later when writing our OS, we will handcraft the kernel image
  by explicitly linking the object files (produced by gcc)
  through a linker script. We will specify the memory layout of
  sections by specifying at what addresses they will appear in
  the final image. But we will not assign any section flag and
  let the linker take care of it. Nevertheless, knowing which
  flag does what is useful.

  Align is a value that enforces the offset of a section should
  be divisible by the value. Only 0 and positive integral powers
  of two are allowed. Values 0 and 1 mean the section has no
  alignment constraint.

Output of .interp section:

  Nr is 1.

  Type is PROGBITS, which means this section is part of the
  program.

  Address is 0x0000000000400238, which means the program is
  loaded at this virtual memory address at runtime.

  Offset is 0x00000238 bytes into file.

  Size is 0x000000000000001c in bytes.

  EntSize is 0, which means this section does not have any
  fixed-size entry.

  Flags are A (Allocatable), which means this section consumes
  memory at runtime.

  Info and Link are 0 and 0, which means this section links to no
  section or entry in any table.

  Align is 1, which means no alignment.

  Nr is 14.

  Type is PROGBITS, which means this section is part of the
  program.

  Address is 0x00000000004003e0, which means the program is
  loaded at this virtual memory address at runtime.

  Offset is 0x000003e0 bytes into file.

  Size is 0x0000000000000192 in bytes.

  EntSize is 0, which means this section does not have any
  fixed-size entry.

  Flags are A (Allocatable) and X (Executable), which means this
  section consumes memory and can be executed as code at runtime.

  Info and Link are 0 and 0, which means this section links to no
  section or entry in any table.

  Align is 16, which means the starting address of the section
  should be divisible by 16, or 0x10. Indeed, it is: \mathtt{0x3e0/0x10=0x3e}

  Understand Section in-depth

In this section, we will learn different details of section types
and the purposes of special sections e.g. .bss, .text, .data...
by looking at each section one by one. We will also examine the
content of each section as a hexdump with the commands:



$ readelf -x <section name|section number> <file>



For example, if you want to examine the content of section with
index 25 (the .bss section in the sample output) in the file
hello:



$ readelf -x 25 hello



Equivalently, using name instead of index works:



$ readelf -x .data hello



If a section contains strings e.g. string symbol table, the flag
-x can be replaced with -p.

  NULL marks a section header as inactive and does not have an
  associated section. NULL section is always the first entry of
  section header table. It means, any useful section starts from
  1.

  The sample output of NULL section:



    [Nr] Name             Type             Address
    Offset

         Size             EntSize          Flags  Link  Info
    Align

    [ 0]                  NULL             0000000000000000

         0000000000000000 0000000000000000           0     0
    0



  Examining the content, the section is empty:



   Section '' has no data to dump.



  NOTE marks a section with special information that other
  programs will check for conformance, compatibility... by a
  vendor or a system builder.

  In the sample output, we have 2 NOTE sections:



    [Nr] Name              Type             Address
    Offset

         Size              EntSize          Flags  Link  Info

  Examine 2nd section with the command:



  $ readelf -x 2 hello



  we have:



  Hex dump of section '.note.ABI-tag':

    0x00400254 04000000 10000000 01000000 474e5500

  PROGBITS indicates a section holding the main content of a
  program, either code or data.

  There are many PROGBITS sections:

  For our operating system, we only need the following section:

  .text

    This section holds all the compiled code of a program.

  .data

    This section holds the initialized data of a program. Since
    the data are initialized with actual values, gcc allocates
    the section with actual byte in the executable binary.

  .rodata

    This section holds read-only data, such as fixed-size strings
    in a program, e.g. “Hello World”, and others.

  .bss

    This section, shorts for Block Started by Symbol, holds
    uninitialized data of a program. Unlike other sections, no
    space is allocated for this section in the image of the
    executable binary on disk. The section is allocated only when
    the program is loaded into main memory.

  Other sections are mainly needed for dynamic linking, that is
  code linking at runtime for sharing between many programs. To
  enable such feature, an OS as a runtime environment must be
  presented. Since we run our OS on bare metal, we are
  effectively creating such environment. For simplicity, we won't
  add dynamic linking to our OS.

  SYMTAB and DYNSYM These sections hold symbol table. A symbol
  table is an array of entries that describe symbols in a
  program. A symbol is a name assigned to an entity in a program.
  The types of these entities are also the types of symbols, and
  these are the possible types of an entity:

  In the sample output, section 5 and 29 are symbol tables:



    [Nr] Name              Type             Address
    Offset

         Size              EntSize          Flags  Link  Info

    To show the symbol table:

    Output consists of 2 symbol tables, corresponding to the two
    sections above, .dynsym and .symtab:

  TLS	The symbol is associated with a Thread-Local Storage
    entity.

  Num is the index of an entry in a table.

  Value is the virtual memory address where the symbol is
    located.

  Size is the size of the entity associated with a symbol.

  Type is a symbol type according to table.

    NOTYPE The type of a symbol is not specified.

    OBJECT	The symbol is associated with a data object. In C, any
      variable definition is of OBJECT type.

    FUNC The symbol is associated with a function or other
      executable code.

    SECTION	The symbol is associated with a section, and exists
      primarily for relocation.

    FILE The symbol is the name of a source file associated with
      an executable binary.

    COMMON	The symbol labels an uninitialized variable. That is,
      when a variable in C is defined as global variable without
      an initial value, or as an external variable using the
      extern keyword. In other words, these variables stay in
      .bss section.

  Bind is the scope of a symbol.

    LOCAL are symbols that are only visible in the object files
      that defined them. In C, the static modifier marks a symbol
      (e.g. a variable/function) as local to only the file that
      defines it.

      If we define variables and functions with static modifer:

        static int global_static_var = 0;



static void local_func() {

}



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    static int local_static_var = 0;



    return 0;

}

      Then we get the static variables listed as local symbols
      after compiling:



        $ gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello

        $ readelf -s hello





        Symbol table '.dynsym' contains 5 entries:

           Num:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name

         ......... output omitted .........



    GLOBAL	are symbols that are accessible by other object files
      when linking together. These symbols are primarily
      non-static functions and non-static global data. The extern
      modifier marks a symbol as externally defined elsewhere but
      is accessible in the final executable binary, so an extern
      variable is also considered GLOBAL.

      Similar to the LOCAL example above, the output lists many
      GLOBAL symbols such as main:

        Num:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name

        ......... output omitted .........

         66: 080483e1    10 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   14 main

    WEAK are symbols whose definitions can be redefined.
      Normally, a symbol with multiple definitions are reported
      as an error by a compiler. However, this constraint is lax
      when a definition is explicitly marked as weak, which means
      the default implementation can be replaced by a different
      definition at link time.

      Suppose we have a default implementation of the function
      add:

        #include <stdio.h>



__attribute__((weak)) int add(int a, int b) {

    printf("warning: function is not implemented.\n");

    return 0;

}



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("add(1,2) is %d\n", add(1,2));

    return 0;

}

        __attribute__((weak)) is a [margin:
function attribute
]function attribute. A function attributefunction attribute is
        extra information for a compiler to handle a function
        differently from a normal function. In this example, weak
        attribute makes the function add a weak function,which
        means the default implementation can be replaced by a
        different definition at link time. Function attribute is
        a feature of a compiler, not standard C.

        If we do not supply a different function definition in a
        different file (must be in a different file, otherwise
        gcc reports as an error), then the default implementation
        is applied. When the function add is called, it only
        prints the message: "warning: function not
        implemented"and returns 0:



        $ ./hello

        warning: function is not implemented.

        add(1,2) is 0



        However, if we supply a different definition in another
        file e.g. math.c:

        int add(int a, int b) {

    return a + b;

}

        and compile the two files together:



        $ gcc math.c hello.c -o hello



        Then, when running hello, no warning message is printed
        and the correct value is returned.

        Weak symbol is a mechanism to provide a default
        implementation, but replaceable when a better
        implementation is available (e.g. more specialized and
        optimized) at link-time.

  Vis is the visibility of a symbol. The following values are
    available:

  Name is the symbol name.

  A C application program always starts from symbol main. The
  entry for main in the symbol table in .symtab section is:



    Num:                Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx
    Name

     62:     0000000000400526    32 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   14
    main



  The entry shows that:

  • main is the 62[superscript:th] entry in the table.

  • main starts at address 0x0000000000400526.

  • main consumes 32 bytes.

  • main is a function.

  • main is in global scope.

  • main is visible to other object files that use it.

  • main is inside the 14[superscript:th] section, which is .text. This is logical, since .text holds all
    program code.

  STRTAB hold a table of null-terminated strings, called string
  table. The first and last byte of this section is always a NULL
  character. A string table section exists because a string can
  be reused by more than one section to represent symbol and
  section names, so a program like readelf or objdump can display
  various objects in a program, e.g. variable, functions, section
  names, in a human-readable text instead of its raw hex address.

  In the sample output, section 28 and 30 are of STRTAB type:



    [Nr] Name              Type             Address
    Offset

         Size              EntSize          Flags  Link  Info

    [30] .strtab           STRTAB           0000000000000000

    1



  .shstrtab holds all the section names.

  .strtab holds the symbols e.g. variable names, function names,
    struct names, etc., in a C program, but not fixed-size
    null-terminated C strings; the C strings are kept in .rodata
    section.

  Strings in those section can be inspected with the command:



    $ readelf -p 29 hello



    The output shows all the section names, with the offset (also
    the string index) into .shstrtab the table to the left:

    The actual implementation of a string table is a contiguous
    array of null-terminated strings. The index of a string is
    the position of its first character in the array. For
    example, in the above string table, .symtab is at index 1 in
    the array (NULL character is at index 0). The length of
    .symtab is 7, plus the NULL character, which occurs 8 bytes
    in total. So, .strtab starts at index 9, and so on.

  HASH holds a symbol hash table, which supports symbol table
  access.

  DYNAMIC holds information for dynamic linking.

  NOBITS is similar to PROGBITS but occupies no space.

  .bss section holds uninitialized data, which means the bytes in
  the section can have any value. Until a operating system
  actually loads the section into main memory, there is no need
  to allocate space for the binary image on disk to reduce the
  size of a binary file. Here is the details of .bss from the
  example output:



  [Nr] Name              Type             Address
  Offset

       Size              EntSize          Flags  Link  Info
  Align

  [26] .bss              NOBITS           0000000000601038

       0000000000000008  0000000000000000  WA       0     0     1


  [27] .comment          PROGBITS         0000000000000000

       0000000000000034  0000000000000001  MS       0     0     1



  In the above output, the size of the section is only 8 bytes,
  while the offsets of both sections are the same, which means
  .bss consumes no byte of the executable binary on disk.

  Notice that the .comment section has no starting address. This
  means that this section is discarded when the executable binary
  is loaded into memory.

  REL holds relocation entries without explicit addends. This
  type will be explained in details in [sec:Understand-relocations-with-readelf]

  RELA holds relocation entries with explicit addends. This type
  will be explained in details in [sec:Understand-relocations-with-readelf]

  INIT_ARRAY is an array of function pointers for program
  initialization. When an application program runs, before
  getting to main(), initialization code in .init and this
  section are executed first. The first element in this array is
  an ignored function pointer.

  It might not make sense when we can include initialization code
  in the main() function. However, for shared object files where
  there are no main(), this section ensures that the
  initialization code from an object file executes before any
  other code to ensure a proper environment for main code to run
  properly. It also makes an object file more modularity, as the
  main application code needs not to be responsible for
  initializing a proper environment for using a particular object
  file, but the object file itself. Such a clear division makes
  code cleaner.

  However, we will not use any .init and INIT_ARRAY sections in
  our operating system, for simplicity, as initializing an
  environment is part of the operating-system domain.

  To use the INIT_ARRAY, we simply mark a function with the
  attribute constructor:

    #include <stdio.h>



__attribute__((constructor)) static void init1(){

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



__attribute__((constructor)) static void init2(){

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}





int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("hello world\n");



    return 0;

}

    The program automatically calls the constructor without
    explicitly invoking it:



    $ gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello

    $ ./hello

    init1

    init2

    hello world





  Optionally, a constructor can be assigned with a priority from
  101 onward. The priorities from 0 to 100 are reserved for gcc.
  If we want init2 to run before init1, we give it a higher
  priority:

    #include <stdio.h>



__attribute__((constructor(102))) static void init1(){

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



__attribute__((constructor(101))) static void init2(){

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}





int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("hello world\n");



    return 0;

}

    The call order should be exactly as specified:



  $ gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello

  $ ./hello

  init2

  init1

  hello world





  We can add initialization functions using another method:

    #include <stdio.h>



void init1() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



void init2() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



/* Without typedef, init is a definition of a function pointer.

   With typedef, init is a declaration of a type.*/

typedef void (*init)();



__attribute__((section(".init_array"))) init init_arr[2] =
{init1, init2};



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("hello world!\n");



    return 0;

}

    The attribute section(“...”) put a function into a particular
    section rather then the default .text. In this example, it is
    .init_arary. Again, the program automatically calls the
    constructors without explicitly invoking it:



    $ gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello

    $ ./hello

    init1

  init2

  hello world!



  FINI_ARRAY is an array of function pointers for program
  termination, called after exiting main(). If the application
  terminate abnormally, such as through abort() call or a crash,
  the .finit_array is ignored.

  A destructor is automatically called after exiting main(), if
  one or more available:

  #include <stdio.h>



__attribute__((destructor)) static void destructor(){

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("hello world\n");



    return 0;

}



  $ gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello

  $ ./hello

  hello world

  destructor



  PREINIT_ARRAY is an array of function pointers that are invoked
  before all other initialization functions in INIT_ARRAY.

  To use the .preinit_array, the only way to put functions into
  this section is to use the attribute section():

  #include <stdio.h>



void preinit1() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



void preinit2() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



void init1() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}



void init2() {

    printf("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

}





typedef void (*preinit)();

typedef void (*init)();



__attribute__((section(".init_array"))) preinit preinit_arr[2] =
{preinit1, preinit2};

__attribute__((section(".init_array"))) init init_arr[2] =
{init1, init2};



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("hello world!\n");



    return 0;

}



  $ gcc -m32 hello2.c -o hello2

  $ ./hello2

  preinit1

  preinit2

  init1

  init2

  hello world!



  GROUP defines a section group, which is the same section that
  appears in different object files but when merged into the
  final executable binary file, only one copy is kept and the
  rest in other object files are discarded. This section is only
  relevant in C++ object files, so we will not examine further.

  SYMTAB_SHNDX is a section containing extended section indexes,
  that are associated with a symbol table. This section only
  appears when the Ndx value of an entry in the symbol table
  exceeds the LORESERVE value. This section then maps between a
  symbol and an actual index value of a section header.

Upon understanding section types, we can understand the number in
Link and Info fields:

Verify that the value of the Link field of a SYMTAB section is
the index of a STRTAB section.



Verify that the value of the Info field of a SYMTAB section is
the index of last local symbol + 1. It means, in the symbol
table, from the index listed by Info field onward, no local
symbol appears.



Verify that the value of the Info field of a REL section is the
index of the SYMTAB section.



Verify that the value of the Link field of a REL section is the
index of the section where relocation is applied. For example. if
the section is .rel.text, then the relocating section should be
.text.

  Program header table<sec:Program-header-table>

A program header tableprogram header table is an array of program
headers that defines the memory layout of a program at runtime.

A program headerprogram header is a description of a program
segment.

A program segmentprogram segment is a collection of related
sections. A segment contains zero or more sections. An operating
system when loading a program, only use segments, not sections.
To see the information of a program header table, we use the -l
option with readelf:



$ readelf -l <binary file>



Similar to a section, a program header also has types:

  PHDR specifies the location and size of the program header
  table itself, both in the file and in the memory image of the
  program

  INTERP specifies the location and size of a null-terminated
  path name to invoke as an interpreter for linking runtime
  libraries.

  LOAD specifies a loadable segment. That is, this segment is
  loaded into main memory.

  DYNAMIC specifies dynamic linking information.

  NOTE specifies the location and size of auxiliary information.

  TLS specifies the Thread-Local Storage template, which is
  formed from the combination of all sections with the flag TLS.

  GNU_STACK indicates whether the program's stack should be made
  executable or not. Linux kernel uses this type.

A segment also has permission, which is a combination of these 3
values:[float MarginTable:
[MarginTable 3:
Segment Permission
]


+-------------+-------------+
| Permission  | Description |

  In the sample output, LOAD segment appears twice:



  LOAD           0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000400000
  0x0000000000400000

  Why? Notice the permission:

  • the upper LOAD has Read and Execute permission. This is a
    text segment. A text segment contains read-only instructions
    and read-only data.

  • the lower LOAD has Read and Write permission. This is a data
    segment. It means that this segment can be read and written
    to, but is not allowed to be used as executable code, for
    security reason.

  Then, LOAD contains the following sections:



     02     .interp .note.ABI-tag .note.gnu.build-id .gnu.hash
  .dynsym .dynstr

  .gnu.version .gnu.version_r .rela.dyn .rela.plt .init .plt
  .plt.got .text .fini

  .rodata .eh_frame_hdr .eh_frame

     03     .init_array .fini_array .jcr .dynamic .got .got.plt
  .data .bss



  The first number is the index of a program header in program
  header table, and the remaining text is the list of all
  sections within a segment. Unfortunately, readelf does not
  print the index, so a user needs to keep track manually which
  segment is of which index. First segment starts at index 0,
  second at index 1 and so on. LOAD are segments at index 2 and
  3. As can be seen from the two lists of sections, most sections
  are loadable and is available at runtime.


-------------------------------------------


  Segments vs sections

As mentioned earlier, an operating system loads program segments,
not sections. However, a question arises: Why doesn't the
operating system use sections instead? After all, a section also
contains similar information to a program segment, such as the
type, the virtual memory address to be loaded, the size, the
attributes, the flags and align. As explained before, a segment
is the perspective of an operating system, while a section is the
perspective of a linker. To understand why, looking into the
structure of a segment, we can easily see:

• A segment is a collection of sections. It means that sections
  are logically grouped together by their attributes. For
  example, all sections in a LOAD segment are always loaded by
  the operating system; all sections have the same permission,
  either a RE (Read + Execute) for executable sections, or RW
  (Read + Write) for data sections.

• By grouping sections into a segment, it is easier for an
  operating system to batch load sections just once by loading
  the start and end of a segment, instead of loading section by
  section.

• Since a segment is for loading a program and a section is for
  linking a program, all the sections in a segment is within its
  start and end virtual memory addresses of a segment.

To see the last point clearer, consider an example of linking two
object files. Suppose we have two source files:

#include <stdio.h>



int main(int argc, char *argv[])

{

    printf("Hello World\n");

    return 0;

}

and:

int add(int a, int b) {

    return a + b;

}

Now, compile the two source files as object files:



$ gcc -m32 -c math.c

$ gcc -m32 -c hello.c



Then, we check the sections of math.o:



$ readelf -S math.o





There are 11 section headers, starting at offset 0x1a8:

As shown in the output, all the section virtual memory addresses
of every section are set to 0. At this stage, each object file is
simply a block of binary that contains code and data. Its
existence is to serve as a material container for the final
product, which is the executable binary. As such, the virtual
addresses in hello.o are all zeroes.

No segment exists at this stage:



$ readelf -l math.o

There are no program headers in this file.



The same happens to other object file:

Every loadable section is assigned an address, highlighted in
green. The reason each section got its own address is that in
reality, gcc does not combine an object by itself, but invokes
the linker ld. The linker ld uses the default script that it can
find in the system to build the executable binary. In the default
script, a segment is assigned a starting address 0x8048000 and
sections belong to it. Then:

• \mathtt{1^{st}\,section\,address=starting\,segment\,address+section\,offset=0x8048000+0x154=0x08048154}


• \mathtt{2^{nd}\,section\,address=starting\,segment\,address+section\,offset=0x8048000+0x168=0x08048168}


• .... and so on until the last loadable section...

Indeed, the end address of a segment is also the end address of
the final section. We can see this by listing all the segments:



$ readelf -l hello



And check, for example, LOAD segment which starts at 0x08048000
and end at \mathtt{0x08048000+0x005fc=0x080485fc}
:

The last section in the first LOAD segment is .eh_frame. The
section starts at 0x08048510, with the offset 0x510 and its size
is 0xec. The end address of .eh_frame should be: \mathtt{0x08048510+0x510+0xec=0x080485fc},
exactly the same as the end address of the first LOAD segment.

Chapter [chap:Linking-and-loading] will explore this whole
process in detail.
